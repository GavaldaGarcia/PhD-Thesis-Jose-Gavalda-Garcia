\begin{itemize}
    \item Can we define a protein structure representation that better captures statistical behaviour when multiple conformations are present? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To address this....
        
    \end{itemize}
    \item Can we describe this statistical behaviour based on data that more accurately reflects protein behaviour in solution?
    \item Can AlphaFoldâ€™s local metric for prediction confidence (pLDDT) effectively describe ambiguous protein behaviour?
    \item Do AlphaFold models reflect information obtained from protein NMR ensembles, experimental NMR metrics of dynamics, and interpreted molecular dynamics data?
    \item Can we identify biases and limitations within AlphaFold models?
\end{itemize}

Main point is the problem/question. Subpoints are how we're fixing it
