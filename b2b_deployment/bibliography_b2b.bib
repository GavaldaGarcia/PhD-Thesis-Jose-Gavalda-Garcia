	abstract = {Protein function and dynamics are closely related; however, accurate dynamics information is difficult to obtain. Here based on a carefully assembled data set derived from experimental data for proteins in solution, we quantify backbone dynamics properties on the amino-acid level and develop DynaMine—a fast, high-quality predictor of protein backbone dynamics. DynaMine uses only protein sequence information as input and shows great potential in distinguishing regions of different structural organization, such as folded domains, disordered linkers, molten globules and pre-structured binding motifs of different sizes. It also identifies disordered regions within proteins with an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated existing predictors, without depending on prior disorder knowledge or three-dimensional structural information. DynaMine provides molecular biologists with an important new method that grasps the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, as we show here for human p53 and E1A from human adenovirus 5.},

Unfortunately, accurate protein dynamics information is difficult to obtain: here we present the DynaMine webserver, which provides predictions for the fast backbone movements of proteins directly from their amino-acid sequence. DynaMine rapidly produces a profile describing the statistical potential for such movements at residue-level resolution. The predicted values have meaning on an absolute scale and go beyond the traditional binary classification of residues as ordered or disordered, thus allowing for direct dynamics comparisons between protein regions. Through this webserver, we provide molecular biologists with an efficient and easy to use tool for predicting the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, even in the absence of experimental observations. The prediction results are visualized and can be directly downloaded.

These IDRs continue to challenge structural biology experiments because they lack a well-defined conformation, and bioinformatics approaches that accurately delineate disordered protein regions remain essential for their identification and further investigation. Typically, these predictors use the protein amino acid sequence, without taking into account likely sequence-dependent emergent properties, such as protein backbone dynamics. Here we present DisoMine, a method that predicts protein'long disorder' with recurrent neural networks from simple predictions of protein dynamics, secondary structure and early folding. The tool is fast and requires only a single sequence, making it applicable for large-scale screening, including poorly studied and orphan proteins. DisoMine is a top performer in its category and compares well to disorder prediction approaches using evolutionary information.

Especially poorly understood are the very early stages of protein folding, which are likely defined by intrinsic local interactions between amino acids close to each other in the protein sequence. We here present EFoldMine, a method that predicts, from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which amino acids are likely involved in early folding events. The method is based on early folding data from hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) data from NMR pulsed labelling experiments, and uses backbone and sidechain dynamics as well as secondary structure propensities as features. The EFoldMine predictions give insights into the folding process, as illustrated by a qualitative comparison with independent experimental observations. Furthermore, on a quantitative proteome scale, the predicted early folding residues tend to become the residues that interact the most in the folded structure, and they are often residues that display evolutionary covariation. The connection of the EFoldMine predictions with both folding pathway data and the folded protein structure suggests that the initial statistical behavior of the protein chain with respect to local structure formation has a lasting effect on its subsequent states.},

The aim of our predictions is to identify the biophysical behaviour or features of proteins that are not readily captured by structural biology and/or molecular dynamics approaches. Upload of a FASTA file or text input of a sequence provides integrated predictions from DynaMine backbone and side-chain dynamics, conformational propensities, and derived EFoldMine early folding, DisoMine disorder, and Agmata β-sheet aggregation. These predictions, several of which were previously not available online, capture ‘emergent’ properties of proteins, i.e. the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in their sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour (e.g. final folded state). In addition, upload of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a variety of formats enables exploration of the biophysical variation observed in homologous proteins. The associated plots indicate the biophysical limits of functionally relevant protein behaviour, with unusual residues flagged by a Gaussian mixture model analysis. The prediction results are available as JSON or CSV files and directly accessible via an API. Online visualisation is available as interactive plots, with brief explanations and tutorial pages included. The server and API employ an email-free token-based system that can be used to anonymously access previously generated results.},

	abstract = {Detailed descriptions of atomic coordinates and motions are required for an understanding of protein dynamics and their relation to molecular recognition, catalytic function, and allostery. Historically, NMR relaxation measurements have played a dominant role in the determination of the amplitudes and timescales (picosecond–nanosecond) of bond vector fluctuations, whereas high-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments can reveal the presence of and provide atomic coordinates for multiple, weakly populated substates in the protein conformational ensemble. Here we report a hybrid NMR and X-ray crystallography analysis that provides a more complete dynamic picture and a more quantitative description of the timescale and amplitude of fluctuations in atomic coordinates than is obtainable from the individual methods alone. Order parameters (S2) were calculated from single-conformer and multiconformer models fitted to room temperature and cryogenic X-ray diffraction data for dihydrofolate reductase. Backbone and side-chain order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments are in excellent agreement with those calculated from the room-temperature single-conformer and multiconformer models, showing that the picosecond timescale motions observed in solution occur also in the crystalline state. These motions are quenched in the crystal at cryogenic temperatures. The combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography in iterative refinement promises to provide an atomic resolution description of the alternate conformational substates that are sampled through picosecond to nanosecond timescale fluctuations of the protein structure. The method also provides insights into the structural heterogeneity of nonmethyl side chains, aromatic residues, and ligands, which are less commonly analyzed by NMR relaxation measurements.},

	abstract = {Protein flexibility lies at the heart of many protein–ligand binding events and enzymatic activities. However, the experimental measurement of protein motions is often difficult, tedious and error-prone. As a result, there is a considerable interest in developing simpler and faster ways of quantifying protein flexibility. Recently, we described a method, called Random Coil Index (RCI), which appears to be able to quantitatively estimate model-free order parameters and flexibility in protein structural ensembles using only backbone chemical shifts. Because of its potential utility, we have undertaken a more detailed investigation of the RCI method in an attempt to ascertain its underlying principles, its general utility, its sensitivity to chemical shift errors, its sensitivity to data completeness, its applicability to other proteins, and its general strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we find that the RCI method is very robust and that it represents a useful addition to traditional methods of studying protein flexibility. We have implemented many of the findings and refinements reported here into a web server that allows facile, automated predictions of model-free order parameters, MD RMSF and NMR RMSD values directly from backbone 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments.

This problem is difficult because these states are conformationally highly heterogeneous and cannot be represented as single structures, and therefore it is necessary to characterize their conformational properties in terms of probability distributions. Here we show that it is possible to obtain highly quantitative information about particularly important types of probability distributions, the populations of secondary structure elements (α-helix, β-strand, random coil, and polyproline II), by using the information provided by backbone chemical shifts. The application of this approach to mammalian prions indicates that for these proteins a key role in molecular recognition is played by disordered regions characterized by highly conserved polyproline II populations. We also determine the secondary structure populations of a range of other disordered proteins that are medically relevant, including p53, α-synuclein, and the Aβ peptide, as well as an oligomeric form of αB-crystallin. Because chemical shifts are the nuclear magnetic resonance parameters that can be measured under the widest variety of conditions, our approach can be used to obtain detailed information about secondary structure populations for a vast range of different protein states.},

experimental kinetics of protein folding began in the early
1990s with the introduction of nanosecond laser pulses to trigger
the folding reaction, providing an almost 106-fold improvement
in time resolution over the stopped-flow method being employed at
the time. These experiments marked the beginning of the “fast-folding”
subfield that enabled investigation of the kinetics of formation of
secondary structural elements and disordered loops for the first time,
as well as the fastest folding proteins. When I started to work on
this subject, a fast folding protein was one that folded in milliseconds.
There were, moreover, no analytical theoretical models and no atomistic
or coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to describe the mechanism.
Two of the most important discoveries from my lab since then are a
protein that folds in hundreds of nanoseconds, as determined from
nanosecond laser temperature experiments, and the discovery that the
theoretically predicted barrier crossing time is about the same for
proteins that differ in folding rates by 104-fold, as determined
from single molecule fluorescence measurements. We also developed
what has been called the “Hückel model” of protein
folding, which quantitatively explains a wide range of equilibrium
and kinetic measurements. This retrospective traces the history of
contributions to the “fast folding” subfield from my
lab until about 3 years ago, when I left protein folding to spend
the rest of my research career trying to discover an inexpensive drug
for treating sickle cell disease.},

	abstract = {Protein beta-aggregation is an important but poorly understood phenomena involved in diseases as well as in beneficial physiological processes. However, while this task has been investigated for over 50 years, very little is known about its mechanisms of action. Moreover, the identification of regions involved in aggregation is still an open problem and the state-of-the-art methods are often inadequate in real case applications.In this article we present AgMata, an unsupervised tool for the identification of such regions from amino acidic sequence based on a generalized definition of statistical potentials that includes biophysical information. The tool outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two different benchmarks. As case-study, we applied our tool to human ataxin-3, a protein involved in Machado–Joseph disease. Interestingly, AgMata identifies aggregation-prone residues that share the very same structural environment. Additionally, it successfully predicts the outcome of in vitro mutagenesis experiments, identifying point mutations that lead to an alteration of the aggregation propensity of the wild-type ataxin-3.A python implementation of the tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/bio2byte/agmata.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain different membrane-delimited compartments, which are crucial for the biochemical reactions necessary to sustain cell life. Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins (PSPs) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in PSPs research.Here we present PSPer, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like RNA-binding PSPs. We show that it can prioritize PSPs among proteins containing similar RNA-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. PSPer is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely PSPs for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.PSPer is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data provides valuable information on the behaviour of proteins in solution. The primary data to determine when studying proteins are the per-atom NMR chemical shifts, which reflect the local environment of atoms and provide insights into amino acid residue dynamics and conformation. Within an amino acid residue, chemical shifts present multi-dimensional and complexly cross-correlated information, making them difficult to analyse. The ShiftCrypt method, based on neural network auto-encoder architecture, compresses the per-amino acid chemical shift information in a single, interpretable, amino acid-type independent value that reflects the biophysical state of a residue. We here present the ShiftCrypt web server, which makes the method readily available. The server accepts chemical shifts input files in the NMR Exchange Format (NEF) or NMR-STAR format, executes ShiftCrypt and visualises the results, which are also accessible via an API. It also enables the ”biophysically-based” pairwise alignment of two proteins based on their ShiftCrypt values. This approach uses Dynamic Time Warping and can optionally include their amino acid code information, and has applications in, for example, the alignment of disordered regions. The server uses a token-based system to ensure the anonymity of the users and results. The web server is available at www.bio2byte.be/shiftcrypt.},

	abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

We here develop a method, SECRiFY, to simultaneously assess the secretability of {\textgreater}105 protein fragments by two yeast species, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris, using custom fragment libraries, surface display and a sequencing-based readout. Screening human proteome fragments with a median size of 50–100 amino acids, we generate datasets that enable datamining into protein features underlying secretability, revealing a striking role for intrinsic disorder and chain flexibility. The SECRiFY methodology generates sufficient amounts of annotated data for advanced machine learning methods to deduce secretability patterns. The finding that secretability is indeed a learnable feature of protein sequences provides a solid base for application-focused studies.},

	abstract = {Secretory preproteins of the Sec pathway are targeted post‐translationally and cross cellular membranes through translocases. During cytoplasmic transit, mature domains remain non‐folded for translocase recognition/translocation. After translocation and signal peptide cleavage, mature domains fold to native states in the bacterial periplasm or traffic further. We sought the structural basis for delayed mature domain folding and how signal peptides regulate it. We compared how evolution diversified a periplasmic peptidyl‐prolyl isomerase PpiA mature domain from its structural cytoplasmic PpiB twin. Global and local hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry showed that PpiA is a slower folder. We defined at near‐residue resolution hierarchical folding initiated by similar foldons in the twins, at different order and rates. PpiA folding is delayed by less hydrophobic native contacts, frustrated residues and a β‐turn in the earliest foldon and by signal peptide‐mediated disruption of foldon hierarchy. When selected PpiA residues and/or its signal peptide were grafted onto PpiB, they converted it into a slow folder with enhanced in vivo secretion. These structural adaptations in a secretory protein facilitate trafficking., Comparison between a slow‐folding secreted bacterial protein (PpiA) and its fast‐folding cytosolic homologue (PpiB) offers insights into structural features that regulate protein folding.},
