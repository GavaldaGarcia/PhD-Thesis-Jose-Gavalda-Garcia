B) The STRIDE consensus secondary structure assignment here provided is the most abundantly assigned secondary structure in the ensemble of NMR structures available. The STRIDE consensus assignment (panel B) produces a decrease in abundance for helix (H) and sheet (E) fractions as the pLDDT decreases, as well as an increase in coil (C) and turn (T) conformations. These tendencies are maintained for AlphaFold2's single structure assignment (panel A) in sheet and coil fractions, but not for helix and turn.}

    \textbf{AlphaFold3 C-$\alpha$ pLDDT vs. conformational state variability.} 
    A) High pLDDT values (\( \geq 80 \), N = 10,272) concentrate in areas with lower conformational state variability. Low pLDDT \( < 60 \), N = 463) usually correspond to residues with high conformational state variability. B) This tendency is more clearly observed with pLDDT-stratified distributions, which shows that low pLDDT residues correspond to residues with high conformational state variability, therefore with high potential to exist in multiple conformations, and vice-versa for high pLDDT and low variability residues. Mid pLDDT residues \( 80 > \text{pLDDT} \geq 60 \),  N = 634) exhibit an intermediate distribution.
