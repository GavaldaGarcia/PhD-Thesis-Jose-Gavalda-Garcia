Five years come to an end and I finally have the space to look back and reflect on them. These have been the most challenging years of my life, both personally and professionally. The reason why you can now read this thesis is because of those close to me, who have supported me in moments of adversity and celebrated the wins, no matter how big or small. Before I tell you how much I appreciate you and everything you have done for me during these years, I am going to thank myself. I thank myself for not giving up, for becoming kinder with myself, for setting boundaries, for learning that resilience is not enough, and for accepting that reaching out for help is a sign of strength rather than weakness. I thank myself for developing in a way that made me survive this experience. 

This PhD would not have been possible without the opportunity given to me by professor Wim Vranken to be part of his group. Thank you for your guidance and support.

Lots of colleagues have come and go during these years, and I like to think I have learned something from each end every one of them. Some have had special importance in this journey and deserve some extra lines here. Joel, you have a good friend from the very beginning, and I treasure all the climbs, trips, talks, and drinks that we have shared and I'm happy to see you thrive, now from a distance. Aitor, we have not drank as many beers as we should have, all my fault for being a tired boy. I have fond memories of our pre-Covid morning chats whilst you smoked, the advice given, and all the side quests that you suggested for outreach. Thanks to you, Joel and I can say that we have explained our project using a plate of mussels. Paddy, you absolute party beast, you have always put a smile on my face and have taught me, by example, a thing or two about the art of seduction. Please stay true to yourself, you're awesome. David, you rescued me from some of the deepest, scariest moments in my whole PhD, supporting me both emotionally and scientifically. You were my ally when external forces threatened this project and kept me on track. You've played a transcendent role in my life and made me recover the spark in doing science and I will forever be grateful to encounter you in the right time and place. Adrian, my \textit{pibe}, you have been one of the biggest reasons to get out of bed every morning. You have been a safe space to express myself when I felt vulnerable and needed to listen to a calming voice. I keep my cow foot mate on sight to always have you on my mind. Sophie, my ally in the office, I'm happy to have someone to share opinions with about pretty much anything. Opinionated people are cool and we can scream that together. All of you, have been fundamental in the completion of this journey, thank you.
