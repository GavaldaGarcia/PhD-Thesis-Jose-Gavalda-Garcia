	abstract = {Detailed descriptions of atomic coordinates and motions are required for an understanding of protein dynamics and their relation to molecular recognition, catalytic function, and allostery. Historically, NMR relaxation measurements have played a dominant role in the determination of the amplitudes and timescales (picosecond–nanosecond) of bond vector fluctuations, whereas high-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments can reveal the presence of and provide atomic coordinates for multiple, weakly populated substates in the protein conformational ensemble. Here we report a hybrid NMR and X-ray crystallography analysis that provides a more complete dynamic picture and a more quantitative description of the timescale and amplitude of fluctuations in atomic coordinates than is obtainable from the individual methods alone. Order parameters (S2) were calculated from single-conformer and multiconformer models fitted to room temperature and cryogenic X-ray diffraction data for dihydrofolate reductase. Backbone and side-chain order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments are in excellent agreement with those calculated from the room-temperature single-conformer and multiconformer models, showing that the picosecond timescale motions observed in solution occur also in the crystalline state. These motions are quenched in the crystal at cryogenic temperatures. The combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography in iterative refinement promises to provide an atomic resolution description of the alternate conformational substates that are sampled through picosecond to nanosecond timescale fluctuations of the protein structure. The method also provides insights into the structural heterogeneity of nonmethyl side chains, aromatic residues, and ligands, which are less commonly analyzed by NMR relaxation measurements.},

	abstract = {On the basis of optical rotatory dispersion data and other evidence, it was attempted to classify the proteins according to the conformation of their polypeptide chains. Three large groups of globular proteins emerge: 1. proteins with a high $\alpha$-helix content, 2. proteins with a low $\alpha$-helix content, and 3. the nonhelical globular proteins. Recent optical rotatory dispersion data have revealed that the nonhelical proteins can be subdivided into three subgroups: (a) proteins with an unknown order of type I (chymotrypsinogen, elastase, the luteinizing hormone, soyabean trypsin inhibitor, etc.), (b) proteins with an unknown non-helical order of type II (serum γ-globulin, the BENCE JONES proteins), and (c) disordered proteins (phosvitin, histones in aqueous solutions). New results on the following proteins are reported: adenosine deaminase, arginase, bacterial $\alpha$-amylase, collagenase, conalbumin, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyoxalase, 20-$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, isocitric dehydrogenase, nucleoside phosphorylase, ovalbumin, peroxidase, $\alpha$-phosphorylase, phosphotransacetylase, phosphoglycerate mutase, transferrin, triose phosphate isomerase, and xanthine oxidase. The MOFFITT constants (b0) were determined, and the far ultraviolet COTTON effects were studied. Since the rotatory power of completely disordered proteins at the wave length of 198 mμ is now known, the $\alpha$-helix content of the proteins exhibiting the positive maximum in the curves at 198 mμ can be calculated from the amplitude of the maximum using the poly-$\alpha$-L-glutamic acid as standard.},

The temporal overlap of the bioinformatics and NMR studies played a significant role in the development of our understanding of IDPs.

	abstract = {Proteins can exist in a trinity of structures: the ordered state, the molten globule, and the random coil. The five following examples suggest that native protein structure can correspond to any of the three states (not just the ordered state) and that protein function can arise from any of the three states and their transitions. (1) In a process that likely mimics infection, fd phage converts from the ordered into the disordered molten globular state. (2) Nucleosome hyperacetylation is crucial to DNA replication and transcription; this chemical modification greatly increases the net negative charge of the nucleosome core particle. We propose that the increased charge imbalance promotes its conversion to a much less rigid form. (3) Clusterin contains an ordered domain and also a native molten globular region. The molten globular domain likely functions as a proteinaceous detergent for cell remodeling and removal of apoptotic debris. (4) In a critical signaling event, a helix in calcineurin becomes bound and surrounded by calmodulin, thereby turning on calcineurin’s serine/threonine phosphatase activity. Locating the calcineurin helix within a region of disorder is essential for enabling calmodulin to surround its target upon binding. (5) Calsequestrin regulates calcium levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by binding approximately 50 ions/molecule. Disordered polyanion tails at the carboxy terminus bind many of these calcium ions, perhaps without adopting a unique structure. In addition to these examples, we will discuss 16 more proteins with native disorder. These disordered regions include molecular recognition domains, protein folding inhibitors, flexible linkers, entropic springs, entropic clocks, and entropic bristles. Motivated by such examples of intrinsic disorder, we are studying the relationships between amino acid sequence and order/disorder, and from this information we are predicting intrinsic order/disorder from amino acid sequence. The sequence–structure relationships indicate that disorder is an encoded property, and the predictions strongly suggest that proteins in nature are much richer in intrinsic disorder than are those in the Protein Data Bank. Recent predictions on 29 genomes indicate that proteins from eucaryotes apparently have more intrinsic disorder than those from either bacteria or archaea, with typically {\textgreater}30\% of eucaryotic proteins having disordered regions of length ≥ 50 consecutive residues.},

By examining the use-wear traces from over 400 stone tools from funerary contexts of the earliest Neolithic in central Europe we provide insights into what tasks could have been carried out by women and men. The results of this analysis are then examined for statistically significant correlations with the osteological, isotopic and other grave good data, informing on sexed-based differences in diet, mobility and symbolism. Our data demonstrate males were buried with stone tools used for woodwork, and butchery, hunting or interpersonal violence, while women with those for the working of animal skins, expanding the range of tasks known to have been carried out. The results also show variation along an east-west cline from Slovakia to eastern France, suggesting that the sexual division of labour (or at least its representation in death) changed as farming spread westwards.},

Cross-culturally, the outcome of these choices has been the development of a spatial division of labor with agricultural intensification in areas of prime arable land and a mix of extensive agriculture and craft specialization in marginal areas, under specific demand conditions.

In this brief review, in keeping with the theme of this journal, we focus on the close and complex relationship betweeen this blood disease and this infectious disease. On one hand, heterozygotes for the sickle gene (AS) are relatively protected against the danger of dying of malaria, as now firmly established through a number of clinical field studies from different parts of Africa. In addition, experimental work is consistent with a plausibile mechanism: namely, that in AS heterozygotes P falciparum-infected red cells sickle preferentially and are then removed by macrophages. On the other hand, patients who are homozygous for the sickle gene and therefore suffer from sickle cell anaemia (SCA) are highly susceptible to the lethal effects of malaria. The simplest explanation of this fact is that malaria makes the anaemia of SCA more severe; in addition, in SCA there is often hyposplenism, which reduces clearance of parasites. From the point of view of public health it is important that in malaria-endemic countries patients with SCA, and particularly children, be protected from malaria by appropriate prophylaxis.},

	abstract = {Background
Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has historically been associated with high levels of childhood mortality in Africa. Although malaria has a major contribution to this mortality, to date, the clinical pathology of malaria among children with SCA has been poorly described. We aimed to explore the relationship between SCA and Plasmodium falciparum malaria in further detail by investigating the burden and severity of malaria infections among children recruited with severe anaemia to the TRACT trial of blood transfusion in Africa.

Methods
This study is a post-hoc secondary analysis of the TRACT trial data, conducted after trial completion. TRACT was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised controlled trial enrolling children aged 2 months to 12 years who presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin {\textless}6·0 g/dL) to four hospitals in Africa. This secondary analysis is restricted to Uganda, where the birth prevalence of SCA is approximately 1\% and malaria transmission is high. Children were classified as normal (HbAA), heterozygous (HbAS), or homozygous (HbSS; SCA) for the rs334 A→T sickle mutation in HBB following batch-genotyping by PCR at the end of the trial. To avoid confounding from SCA-specific medical interventions, we considered children with an existing diagnosis of SCA (known SCA) separately from those diagnosed at the end of the trial (unknown SCA). The outcomes considered in this secondary analysis were measures of P falciparum parasite burden, features of severe malaria, and mortality at day 28 in malaria-positive children.

Findings
Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3944 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. 3483 children from Uganda were considered in this secondary analysis. Overall, 1038 (30\%) of 3483 Ugandan children had SCA. 1815 (78\%) of 2321 children without SCA (HbAA) tested positive for P falciparum malaria, whereas the prevalence was significantly lower in children with SCA (347 [33\%] of 1038; p{\textless}0·0001). Concentrations of plasma P falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a marker of the total burden of malaria parasites within an individual, were significantly lower in children with either known SCA (median 8 ng/mL; IQR 0–57) or unknown SCA (7 ng/mL; 0–50) than in HbAA children (346 ng/mL; 21–2121; p{\textless}0·0001). In contrast to HbAA children, few HbSS children presented with classic features of severe and complicated malaria, but both the frequency and severity of anaemia were higher in HbSS children. We found no evidence for increased mortality at day 28 in those with SCA compared with those without SCA overall (hazard ratios 1·07 [95\% CI 0·31–3·76] for known SCA and 0·67 [0·15–2·90] for unknown SCA).

Interpretation
The current study suggests that children with SCA are innately protected against classic severe malaria. However, it also shows that even low-level infections can precipitate severe anaemic crises that would likely prove fatal without rapid access to blood transfusion services.

To constitute natural selection, the difference in survival and/or reproduction cannot be due to chance, and it must have the potential consequence of altering the proportions of the different entities. Thus, natural selection is also definable as a deterministic difference in the contribution of different classes of entities to subsequent generations. Usually, the differences are inherited. The entities may be alleles, genotypes or subsets of genotypes, populations, or, in the broadest sense, species.},

I. INTRODUCTION
Before attempting to draw the conclusions, or some of the conclusions, which emerge from the discussions of the past eight days, we would like to express the unanimous feeling of the participants that the choice of the subject and the timing of this conference were excellent, as shown by the exceptional and sustained interest of the sessions. For this we are deeply indebted to our host Dr. Chovnick, Director of the Long Island Biological Laboratory, and to Dr. Umbarger who had a major share in the planning of the conference.
We shall not attempt here to summarize the proceedings of a meeting where such an abundance of observations, pertaining to a wide variety of systems, were presented. We would rather try to reconsider the problem of cellular regulation as a whole, in perspective so to say, as it appears to us as a result of this confrontation.

But only one rotary motor has been investigated in detail, the bacterial flagellum6 (a complex of about 100 protein molecules7). We now show that a single molecule of F1-ATPase acts as a rotary motor, the smallest known, by direct observation of its motion. A central rotor of radius ∼1 nm, formed by its γ-subunit, turns in a stator barrel of radius ∼5nm formed by three $\alpha$- and three $\beta$-subunits8. F1 ATPase, together with the membrane-embedded proton-conducting unit F0, forms the H+-ATP synthase that reversibly couples transmembrane proton flow to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in respiring and photosynthetic cells9,10. It has been suggested that the γ-subunit of F1-ATPase rotates within the $\alpha$$\beta$-hexamer11, a conjecture supported by structural8, biochemical12,13 and spectroscopic14 studies. We attached a fluorescent actin filament to the γ-subunit as a marker, which enabled us to observe this motion directly. In the presence of ATP, the filament rotated for more than 100 revolutions in an anticlockwise direction when viewed from the 'membrane' side. The rotary torque produced reached more than 40 pN nm −l under high load.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which in isolation do not adopt a well-defined tertiary structure but instead populate a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of interconverting states, play important roles in many biological pathways. IDPs often fold into ordered states upon binding to their physiological interaction partners (a so-called “folding-upon-binding” process), but it has proven difficult to obtain an atomic-level description of the structural mechanisms by which they do so. Here, we describe in atomic detail the folding-upon-binding mechanism of an IDP segment to its binding partner, as observed in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, we observed over 70 binding and unbinding events between the $\alpha$-helical molecular recognition element ($\alpha$-MoRE) of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (NTAIL) and the X domain (XD) of the measles virus phosphoprotein complex. We found that folding-upon-binding primarily occurred through induced-folding pathways (in which intermolecular contacts form before or concurrently with the secondary structure of the disordered protein)—an observation supported by previous experiments—and that the transition state ensemble was characterized by  formation of just a few key intermolecular contacts and was otherwise highly structurally heterogeneous. We found that when a large amount of helical content was present early in a transition path, NTAIL typically unfolded and then refolded after additional intermolecular contacts formed. We also found that, among conformations with similar numbers of intermolecular contacts, those with less helical content had a higher probability of ultimately forming the native complex than conformations with more helical content, which were more likely to unbind. These observations suggest that even after intermolecular contacts have formed, disordered regions can have a kinetic advantage over folded regions in the folding-upon-binding process.},

Even if the mechanism is quite complex, IDPs tend to bind their partner in a cooperative manner such that it is generally possible to detect experimentally only the disordered unbound state and the structured complex. The interaction between the disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (N$_{\textrm{TAIL}}$) and the X domain (XD) of the viral phosphoprotein allows us to detect and quantify the two distinct steps of the overall reaction. Here, we analyze the robustness of the folding of N$_{\textrm{TAIL}}$ upon binding to XD by measuring the effect on both the folding and binding steps of N$_{\textrm{TAIL}}$ when the structure of XD is modified. Because it has been shown that wild-type XD is structurally heterogeneous, populating an on-pathway intermediate under native conditions, we investigated the binding to 11 different site-directed variants of N$_{\textrm{TAIL}}$ of one particular variant of XD (I504A XD) that populates only the native state. Data reveal that the recognition and the folding steps are both affected by the structure of XD, indicating a highly malleable pathway. The experimental results are briefly discussed in the light of previous experiments on other IDPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) display a large number of interaction modes including folding-upon-binding, binding without major structural transitions, or binding through highly dynamic, so-called fuzzy, complexes. The vast majority of experimental information about IDP binding modes have been inferred from crystal structures of proteins in complex with short peptides of IDPs. However, crystal structures provide a mainly static view of the complexes and do not give information about the conformational dynamics experienced by the IDP in the bound state. Knowledge of the dynamics of IDP complexes is of fundamental importance to understand how IDPs engage in highly specific interactions without concomitantly high binding affinity. Here, we combine rotating-frame R1ρ, Carr–Purcell–Meiboom Gill relaxation dispersion as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer to decipher the dynamic interaction profile of an IDP in complex with its partner. We apply the approach to the dynamic signaling complex formed between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38$\alpha$ and the intrinsically disordered regulatory domain of the MAPK kinase MKK4. Our study demonstrates that MKK4 employs a subtle combination of interaction modes in order to bind to p38$\alpha$, leading to a complex displaying significantly different dynamics across the bound regions.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functionally active despite lacking a well-defined three-dimensional structure. Such proteins often undergo a disorder-to-order transition, or induced folding, when binding to their specific physiological partner. Because of cooperativity, the folding and binding steps typically appear as a single event, and therefore, induced folding is extremely difficult to characterize experimentally. In this perspective, the interaction between the disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein NTAIL and the folded X domain of the viral phosphoprotein (XD) is particularly interesting because the inherent complexity of the observed kinetics allows characterization of the binding and folding steps individually. Here we present a detailed structural description of the folding and binding events occurring in the recognition between NTAIL and XD. This result was achieved by measuring the effect of single-amino acid substitutions in NTAIL on the reaction mechanism. Analysis of the experimental data allowed us (i) to identify the key residues involved in the initial recognition between the two molecules and (ii) to depict the general features of the folding pathway of NTAIL. Furthermore, an analysis of the changes in stability obtained for the whole set of variants highlights how the sequence of this IDP has not been selected during evolution to fold efficiently. This feature might be a consequence of the weakly funneled nature of the energy landscape of IDPs in their unbound state and represents a plausible explanation of their highly dynamic nature even in the bound state, typically defined as “fuzziness”.},

We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 ± 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism.

	title = {Protein aggregation, hydrophobicity and neurodegenerative disease},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we study the relationship between proteins and neurodegenerative disease using different computational and experimental approaches. We focus on two disease mechanisms: changes in protein abundance and changes in protein structure. Additionally, we investigate the difference in unfolding and refolding profile between native and denatured proteins. Changes in protein structure are especially important in neurodegenerative disease, where large $\beta$-stranded aggregates called amyloid fibrils are thought to play a major role. Some amyloid fibrils are known to denature at low temperatures. In Chapter 2, we delineate the entropic and enthalpic contributions of the temperature dependence of hydrophobicity in relation to cold denaturation. We use Monte Carlo simulations on a 3D lattice to gain mechanistic insight into cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Additionally, we confirm our results using isothermal titration calorimetry experiments on different types of amyloid fibrils in vitro. We identify three necessary conditions for cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. We conclude that while heat denaturation of amyloid fibrils is mostly driven by the chain entropy, cold denaturation of fibrils is mostly driven by the hydrophobic contribution to the enthalpy. In Chapter 3, we define three measures for protein surface hydrophobicity and develop a tool to calculate surface hydrophobicity from 3D protein structure. Additionally, we try to predict these measures from sequence and use these predictions to investigate the abundance of protein surface hydrophobicity in the human proteome. We find that proteins in the human brain are relatively hydrophobic, which could explain why protein aggregation diseases are mostly found in the nervous system. In Chapter 4, we use a combination of Quartz Crystal Microbalance experimental measurements with kinetic models to study the effect of disordered flanks on fibril formation of $\alpha$-synuclein. We find that these flanks have an inhibitory effect on amyloid fibril formation. Without the flanks, amyloid fibril growth was significantly increased. The mathematical models suggest that the increased growth rate is due to secondary nucleation, a process by which monomers bind to the amyloid fibril surface, eventually leading to the growth of new fibrils away from the surface of the initial fibril. In Chapter 5, we investigate the interaction between nanoPET and $\alpha$-synuclein. Nanoplastics are commonly found as pollutants in the environment. We show that nanoPET may be able to enhance amyloid fibril formation of $\alpha$-synuclein, and thus exposure to these compounds might stimulate amyloidoses. Because misfolded proteins can play a role in disease, it would be valuable to be able to distinguish native from misfolded proteins in protein samples. In Chapter 6, we combine steered MD simulations with AFM experiments to study the difference in unfolding pattern between native and denatured Hemoglobin protease (Hbp) proteins at single-molecule level. Additionally, we show that the stability of Hbp comes from a stack of hydrophobic residues in the core of the protein, and study the refolding ability of Hbp after being unfolded. In Chapter 7, we use a proteomics workflow to investigate the molecular pathways affected in frontotemporal dementia, including a novel method to validate the results. We identify and validate several modules of co-abundant proteins affected in FTLD-tau. Specifically, PTBP1 is a protein that plays an important role in the alternative splicing of MAPT, and could be an interesting therapeutic target for diagnosis or treatment of FTD. In conclusion, we have studied the relationship between protein aggregation, hydrophobicity and neurodegenerative disease. In this thesis, we use different experimental and computational techniques to delineate physical factors affecting amyloid fibril formation and growth. We identify hydrophobicity as one of the major physical properties important for aggregation. Additionally, we identify molecular pathways affected in frontotemporal dementia through a novel proteomics workflow.},

	abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a vital, yet often overlooked role in the living cells through modulation of protein properties, such as localization and affinity towards their interactors, thereby enabling quick adaptation to changing environmental conditions. We have previously benchmarked a computational framework for the prediction of PTMs’ effects on the stability of protein-protein interactions, which has molecular dynamics simulations followed by free energy calculations at its core. In the present work, we apply this framework to publicly available data on Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein structures and PTM sites, identified in both normal and stress conditions. We predict proteome-wide effects of acetylations and phosphorylations on protein-protein interactions and find that acetylations more frequently have locally stabilizing roles in protein interactions, while the opposite is true for phosphorylations. However, the overall impact of PTMs on protein-protein interactions is more complex than a simple sum of local changes caused by the introduction of PTMs and adds to our understanding of PTM cross-talk. We further use the obtained data to calculate the conformational changes brought about by PTMs. Finally, conservation of the analyzed PTM residues in orthologues shows that some predictions for yeast proteins will be mirrored to other organisms, including human. This work, therefore, contributes to our overall understanding of the modulation of the cellular protein interaction networks in yeast and beyond.},

	abstract = {Phosphorylations are the most common and extensively studied post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins in eukaryotes. They constitute a major regulatory mechanism, modulating protein function, protein–protein interactions, as well as subcellular localization. Phosphorylation sites are preferably located in intrinsically disordered regions and have been shown to trigger structural rearrangements and order-to-disorder transitions. They can therefore have a significant effect on protein backbone dynamics or conformation, but only sparse experimental data are available. To obtain a more general description of how and when phosphorylations have a significant effect on protein behavior, molecular dynamics (MD) currently provides the only suitable framework to study these effects at a large scale in atomistic detail. This study develops a systematic MD simulation framework to explore the influence of phosphorylations on the local backbone dynamics and conformational propensities of proteins. Through a series of glycine-backbone peptides, we studied the effects of amino acid residues including the three most common phosphorylations (Ser, Thr, and Tyr), on local backbone dynamics and conformational propensities. We further extended our study to investigate the interactions of all such residues between position i to positions i + 1, i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4 in such peptides. The final data set comprises structural ensembles for 3393 sequences with more than 1 μs of sampling for each ensemble. To validate the relevance of the results, the structural and conformational properties extracted from the MD simulations are compared to NMR data from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank. The systematic nature of this study enables the projection of the gained knowledge onto any phosphorylation site in the proteome and provides a general framework for the study of further PTMs. The full data set is publicly available, as a training and reference set.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is widely used to complement ensemble-averaged experiments of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). However, MD often suffers from limitations of inaccuracy. Here, we show that enhancing the sampling using Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (HREMD) led to unbiased and accurate ensembles, reproducing small-angle scattering and NMR chemical shift experiments, for three IDPs of varying sequence properties using two recently optimized force fields, indicating the general applicability of HREMD for IDPs. We further demonstrate that, unlike HREMD, standard MD can reproduce experimental NMR chemical shifts, but not small-angle scattering data, suggesting chemical shifts are insufficient for testing the validity of IDP ensembles. Surprisingly, we reveal that despite differences in their sequence, the inter-chain statistics of all three IDPs are similar for short contour lengths ({\textless} 10 residues). The results suggest that the major hurdle of generating an accurate unbiased ensemble for IDPs has now been largely overcome.},

	abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) can facilitate quick and systematic investigation of protein dynamics using data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We developed an elastic network model-based NMA program using dihedral angles as independent variables. Compared to the NMA programs that use Cartesian coordinates as independent variables, key attributes of the proposed program are as follows: (1) chain connectivity related to the folding pattern of a polypeptide chain is naturally embedded in the model; (2) the full-atom system is acceptable, and owing to a considerably smaller number of independent variables, the PDB data can be used without further manipulation; (3) the number of variables can be easily reduced by some of the rotatable dihedral angles; (4) the PDB data for any molecule besides proteins can be considered without coarse-graining; and (5) individual motions of constituent subunits and ligand molecules can be easily decomposed into external and internal motions to examine their mutual and intrinsic motions. Its performance is illustrated with an example of a DNA-binding allosteric protein, a catabolite activator protein. In particular, the focus is on the conformational change upon cAMP and DNA binding, and on the communication between their binding sites remotely located from each other. In this illustration, NMA creates a vivid picture of the protein dynamics at various levels of the structures, i.e., atoms, residues, secondary structures, domains, subunits, and the complete system, including DNA and cAMP. Comparative studies of the specific protein in different states, e.g., apo- and holo-conformations, and free and complexed configurations, provide useful information for studying structurally and functionally important aspects of the protein.},

The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8.

	abstract = {Background: Data management is fast becoming an essential part of scientific practice, driven by open science and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data sharing requirements. Whilst data management plans (DMPs) are clear to data management experts and data stewards, understandings of their purpose and creation are often obscure to the producers of the data, which in academic environments are often PhD students., 
Methods: Within the RNAct EU Horizon 2020 ITN project, we engaged the 10 RNAct early-stage researchers (ESRs) in a training project aimed at formulating a DMP. To do so, we used the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW) framework and modified the existing Life Sciences Knowledge Model into a simplified version aimed at training young scientists, with computational or experimental backgrounds, in core data management principles. We collected feedback from the ESRs during this exercise., 
Results: Here, we introduce our new life-sciences training DMP template for young scientists. We report and discuss our experiences as principal investigators (PIs) and ESRs during this project and address the typical difficulties that are encountered in developing and understanding a DMP., 
Conclusions: We found that the DS-wizard can also be an appropriate tool for DMP training, to get terminology and concepts across to researchers. A full training in addition requires an upstream step to present basic DMP concepts and a downstream step to publish a dataset in a (public) repository. Overall, the DS-Wizard tool was essential for our DMP training and we hope our efforts can be used in other projects.},

contributed to the broad adoption of the FAIR principles, because individual

also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to

either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations,
or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the

	abstract = {Protein dynamics and related conformational changes are essential for their function but difficult to characterise and interpret. Amino acids in a protein behave according to their local energy landscape, which is determined by their local structural context and environmental conditions. The lowest energy state for a given residue can correspond to sharply defined conformations, e.g. in a stable helix, or can cover a wide range of conformations, e.g. in intrinsically disordered regions. A good definition of such low energy states is therefore important to describe the behaviour of a residue and how it changes with its environment. We propose a data-driven probabilistic definition of six low energy conformational states typically accessible for amino acid residues in proteins. This definition is based on solution NMR information of 1322 proteins through a combined analysis of structure ensembles with interpreted chemical shifts. We further introduce a conformational state variability parameter that captures, based on an ensemble of protein structures from molecular dynamics or other methods, how often a residue moves between these conformational states. The approach enables a different perspective on the local conformational behaviour of proteins that is complementary to their static interpretation from single structure models.},

The interactions are deeply influenced by host immune molecules and anti-viral compounds, as well as by mutations in viral proteins. To understand how these interactions proceed mechanically and how they are influenced by mutations, one needs to know the structures and dynamics of the proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational method for delineating motions of proteins at an atomic-scale via theoretical and empirical principles in physical chemistry. Recent advances in the hardware and software for biomolecular simulation have rapidly improved the precision and performance of this technique. Consequently, MD simulation is quickly extending the range of applications in biology, helping to reveal unique features of protein structures that would be hard to obtain by experimental methods alone. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in MD simulations in the study of virus–host interactions and evolution, and present future perspectives on this technique.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We observed that the diffraction spots at resolutions between 3 Å and 20 Å fade more slowly at liquid-helium temperatures compared to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, by a factor of between 1.2 and 1.8, depending on the specimens. If the reduction in the effective rate of radiation damage for 2D crystals at liquid-helium temperature (as measured by spot fading) can be shown to extend to macromolecular assemblies embedded in amorphous ice, this would suggest that valuable improvements to electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) of biological specimens could be made by reducing the temperature of the specimens under irradiation below what is obtainable using standard liquid-nitrogen cryostats.},

	abstract = {Radiation damage is the most fundamental limitation for achieving high resolution in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of biological samples. The effects of radiation damage are reduced by liquid-helium cooling, although the use of liquid helium is more challenging than that of liquid nitrogen. To date, the benefits of liquid-nitrogen and liquid-helium cooling for single-particle cryo-EM have not been compared quantitatively. With recent technical and computational advances in cryo-EM image recording and processing, such a comparison now seems timely. This study aims to evaluate the relative merits of liquid-helium cooling in present-day single-particle analysis, taking advantage of direct electron detectors. Two data sets for recombinant mouse heavy-chain apoferritin cooled with liquid-nitrogen or liquid-helium to 85 or 17 K were collected, processed and compared. No improvement in terms of resolution or Coulomb potential map quality was found for liquid-helium cooling. Interestingly, beam-induced motion was found to be significantly higher with liquid-helium cooling, especially within the most valuable first few frames of an exposure, thus counteracting any potential benefit of better cryoprotection that liquid-helium cooling may offer for single-particle cryo-EM.},

To obtain cryo-EM images of macromolecules, the samples are first rapidly cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. To what extent the structural ensemble is perturbed during cooling is currently unknown. Here, to quantify the effects of cooling, we combined continuum model calculations of the temperature drop, molecular dynamics simulations of a ribosome complex before and during cooling with kinetic models. Our results suggest that three effects markedly contribute to the narrowing of the structural ensembles: thermal contraction, reduced thermal motion within local potential wells, and the equilibration into lower free-energy conformations by overcoming separating free-energy barriers. During cooling, barrier heights below 10 kJ/mol were found to be overcome, which is expected to reduce B-factors in ensembles imaged by cryo-EM. Our approach now enables the quantification of the heterogeneity of room-temperature ensembles from cryo-EM structures.},

	abstract = {Based on work by Dubochet and others in the 1980s and 1990s, samples for single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have been vitrified using ethane, propane or ethane/propane mixtures. These liquid cryogens have a large difference between their melting and boiling temperatures and so can absorb substantial heat without formation of an insulating vapor layer adjacent to a cooling sample. However, ethane and propane are flammable, they must be liquified in liquid nitro­gen immediately before cryo-EM sample preparation, and cryocooled samples must be transferred to liquid nitro­gen for storage, complicating workflows and increasing the chance of sample damage during handling. Experiments over the last 15 years have shown that cooling rates required to vitrify pure water are only ∼250 000 K s−1, at the low end of earlier estimates, and that the dominant factor that has limited cooling rates of small samples in liquid nitro­gen is sample precooling in cold gas present above the liquid cryogen surface, not the Leidenfrost effect. Using an automated cryocooling instrument developed for cryocrystallography that combines high plunge speeds with efficient removal of cold gas, we show that single-particle cryo-EM samples on commercial grids can be routinely vitrified using only boiling nitro­gen and obtain apoferritin datasets and refined structures with 2.65 Å resolution. The use of liquid nitro­gen as the primary coolant may allow manual and automated workflows to be simplified and may reduce sample stresses that contribute to beam-induced motion.},

At equilibrium, they are characterized by a set of conformations that undergo continuous exchange within a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from nanometers to micrometers and femtoseconds to hours. Dynamic properties of proteins are essential for describing the structural bases of their biological functions including catalysis, binding, regulation and cellular structure. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a powerful technique for measuring these essential features of proteins. Here we provide an introduction to NMR-based approaches for studying protein dynamics, highlighting eight distinct methods with recent examples, contextualized within a common experimental and analytical framework. The selected methods are (1) Real-time NMR, (2) Exchange spectroscopy, (3) Lineshape analysis, (4) CPMG relaxation dispersion, (5) Rotating frame relaxation dispersion, (6) Nuclear spin relaxation, (7) Residual dipolar coupling, (8) Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.

	abstract = {Protein solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be conducted in a slightly anisotropic environment, where the orientational distribution of the proteins is no longer random. In such an environment, the large one-bond internuclear dipolar interactions no longer average to zero and report on the average orientation of the corresponding vectors relative to the magnetic field. The desired very weak ordering, on the order of 10−3, can be induced conveniently by the use of aqueous nematic liquid crystalline suspensions or by anisotropically compressed hydrogels. The resulting residual dipolar interactions are scaled down by three orders of magnitude relative to their static values, but nevertheless can be measured at high accuracy. They are very precise reporters on the average orientation of bonds relative to the molecular alignment frame, and they can be used in a variety of ways to enrich our understanding of protein structure and function. Applications to date have focused primarily on validation of structures, determined by NMR, X-ray crystallography, or homology modeling, and on refinement of structures determined by conventional NMR approaches. Although de novo structure determination on the basis of dipolar couplings suffers from a severe multiple minimum problem, related to the degeneracy of dipolar coupling relative to inversion of the internuclear vector, a number of approaches can address this problem and potentially can accelerate the NMR structure determination process considerably. In favorable cases, where large numbers of dipolar couplings can be measured, inconsistency between measured values can report on internal motions.},

We were able to study thrombin and its complex with thrombomodulin, an allosteric regulator, by both HDX-MS and NMR. In this Perspective, we compare and contrast the results from both experiments and from molecular dynamics simulations. NMR detects changes in the chemical environment around the protein backbone N–H bond vectors, providing residue-level information about the conformational exchange between distinct states. HDX-MS detects changes in amide proton solvent accessibility and H-bonding. Taking advantage of NMR relaxation dispersion measurements of the time scale of motions, we draw conclusions about the motions reflected in HDX-MS experiments. Both experiments detect allostery, but they reveal different components of the allosteric transition. The insights gained from integrating NMR and HDX-MS into thrombin dynamics enable a clearer interpretation of the evidence for allostery revealed by HDX-MS in larger protein complexes and assemblies that are not amenable to NMR.,},

The potency of a ligand binding to a protein is dictated by the binding free energy, which is an intricate interplay between entropy and enthalpy. In addition to providing the atomic resolution structural information, NMR can help to identify protein-ligand interactions that potentially contribute to the enthalpic component of the free energy. NMR can also illuminate dynamic aspects of the interaction, which correspond to the entropic term of the free energy. The ability of NMR to access both terms in the free energy equation stems from the suite of experiments developed to shed light on various aspects that contribute to both entropy and enthalpy, deepening our understanding of the biological function of macromolecules and assisting to target them in physiological conditions. Here we provide a brief account of the contribution of NMR to SBDD, highlighting hallmark examples and discussing the challenges that demand further method development. In the era of integrated biology, the unique ability of NMR to directly ascertain structural and dynamical aspects of macromolecule and monitor changes in these properties upon engaging a ligand can be combined with computational and other structural and biophysical methods to provide a more complete picture of the energetics of drug engagement with the target.

These advances push the limits of NMR studies of large monomeric proteins. Large multimeric and multidomain proteins are studied by NMR when individual components can also be studied by NMR and have known structures.

Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire $\beta$ sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future experiments on this protein.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {The advent of accurate methods to predict the fold of proteins initiated by AlphaFold2 is rapidly changing our understanding of proteins and helping their design. However, these methods are mainly trained on protein structures determined with X-ray diffraction, where the protein is packed in crystals at often cryogenic temperatures. They can therefore only reliably cover well-folded parts of proteins that experience few, if any, conformational changes. Experimentally, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the experimental method of choice to gain insight into protein dynamics at near physiological conditions. Computationally, methods such as molecular dynamics and Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) allow the estimation of a protein’s intrinsic flexibility based on a single protein structure. This work addresses, on a large scale, the relationships for proteins between the AlphaFold2 pLDDT metric, the observed dynamics in solution from NMR metrics, interpreted MD simulations, and the computed dynamics with NMA from single AlphaFold2 models and NMR ensembles. We observe that these metrics agree well for rigid residues that adopt a single well-defined conformation, which are clearly distinct from residues that exhibit dynamic behavior and adopt multiple conformations. This direct order/disorder categorisation is reflected in the correlations observed between the parameters, but becomes very limited when considering only the likely dynamic residues. The gradations of dynamics observed by NMR in flexible protein regions are therefore not represented by these computational approaches.

An actin filament connected to a c subunit oligomer of F0 was able to rotate by using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The rotary torque produced by the c subunit oligomer reached about 40 piconewton-nanometers, which is similar to that generated by the γ subunit in the F1 motor. These results suggest that the γ and c subunits rotate together during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Thus, coupled rotation may be essential for energy coupling between proton transport through F0 and ATP hydrolysis or synthesis in F1.},

This new technique complements older methods and allows a range of new questions to be investigated. What sort of protein is able to resist mechanical unfolding, and to what extent is mechanical stability dictated by fold or function? What is the effect of force on the unfolding energy surface? Do proteins unfold by the same pathway in mechanical and chemical denaturation experiments? Answers to these are starting to emerge based on a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We present some of the forced unfolding experiments to date and simple methods for characterizing the unfolding potential from the results. Several studies have also begun a more fine-grained description of mechanical unfolding, for example by invoking intermediates to explain features seen in unfolding traces and by using mutagenesis to try to localize the origin of mechanical stability. We propose further experimental approaches to this goal using the protein engineering method to characterize transition states, similar to those used in conventional folding experiments. However, it is likely that a high-resolution picture of mechanical unfolding will only emerge through a combined interpretation of careful experimental work and computer simulation.},

It also identifies disordered regions within proteins with an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated existing predictors, without depending on prior disorder knowledge or three-dimensional structural information.

We here present EFoldMine, a method that predicts, from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which amino acids are likely involved in early folding events. The method is based on early folding data from hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) data from NMR pulsed labelling experiments, and uses backbone and sidechain dynamics as well as secondary structure propensities as features. The EFoldMine predictions give insights into the folding process, as illustrated by a qualitative comparison with independent experimental observations. Furthermore, on a quantitative proteome scale, the predicted early folding residues tend to become the residues that interact the most in the folded structure, and they are often residues that display evolutionary covariation. The connection of the EFoldMine predictions with both folding pathway data and the folded protein structure suggests that the initial statistical behavior of the protein chain with respect to local structure formation has a lasting effect on its subsequent states.},

In addition, upload of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a variety of formats enables exploration of the biophysical variation observed in homologous proteins. The associated plots indicate the biophysical limits of functionally relevant protein behaviour, with unusual residues flagged by a Gaussian mixture model analysis.

Started in 2005, Galaxy continues to focus on three key challenges of data-driven biomedical science: making analyses accessible to all researchers, ensuring analyses are completely reproducible, and making it simple to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended. During the last two years, the Galaxy team and the open-source community around Galaxy have made substantial improvements to Galaxy's core framework, user interface, tools, and training materials. Framework and user interface improvements now enable Galaxy to be used for analyzing tens of thousands of datasets, and {\textgreater}5500 tools are now available from the Galaxy ToolShed. The Galaxy community has led an effort to create numerous high-quality tutorials focused on common types of genomic analyses. The Galaxy developer and user communities continue to grow and be integral to Galaxy's development. The number of Galaxy public servers, developers contributing to the Galaxy framework and its tools, and users of the main Galaxy server have all increased substantially.},

	abstract = {Protein flexibility lies at the heart of many protein–ligand binding events and enzymatic activities. However, the experimental measurement of protein motions is often difficult, tedious and error-prone. As a result, there is a considerable interest in developing simpler and faster ways of quantifying protein flexibility. Recently, we described a method, called Random Coil Index (RCI), which appears to be able to quantitatively estimate model-free order parameters and flexibility in protein structural ensembles using only backbone chemical shifts. Because of its potential utility, we have undertaken a more detailed investigation of the RCI method in an attempt to ascertain its underlying principles, its general utility, its sensitivity to chemical shift errors, its sensitivity to data completeness, its applicability to other proteins, and its general strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we find that the RCI method is very robust and that it represents a useful addition to traditional methods of studying protein flexibility. We have implemented many of the findings and refinements reported here into a web server that allows facile, automated predictions of model-free order parameters, MD RMSF and NMR RMSD values directly from backbone 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments. The server is available at http://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/rci.},

The key advantages of this protocol over existing methods for studying protein dynamics are that (i) it does not require prior knowledge of a protein's tertiary structure, (ii) it is not sensitive to the protein's overall tumbling and (iii) it does not require additional NMR measurements beyond the standard experiments for backbone assignments.

This problem is difficult because these states are conformationally highly heterogeneous and cannot be represented as single structures, and therefore it is necessary to characterize their conformational properties in terms of probability distributions. Here we show that it is possible to obtain highly quantitative information about particularly important types of probability distributions, the populations of secondary structure elements ($\alpha$-helix, $\beta$-strand, random coil, and polyproline II), by using the information provided by backbone chemical shifts. The application of this approach to mammalian prions indicates that for these proteins a key role in molecular recognition is played by disordered regions characterized by highly conserved polyproline II populations. We also determine the secondary structure populations of a range of other disordered proteins that are medically relevant, including p53, $\alpha$-synuclein, and the A$\beta$ peptide, as well as an oligomeric form of $\alpha$B-crystallin. Because chemical shifts are the nuclear magnetic resonance parameters that can be measured under the widest variety of conditions, our approach can be used to obtain detailed information about secondary structure populations for a vast range of different protein states.},

experimental kinetics of protein folding began in the early
1990s with the introduction of nanosecond laser pulses to trigger
the folding reaction, providing an almost 106-fold improvement
in time resolution over the stopped-flow method being employed at
the time. These experiments marked the beginning of the “fast-folding”
subfield that enabled investigation of the kinetics of formation of
secondary structural elements and disordered loops for the first time,
as well as the fastest folding proteins. When I started to work on
this subject, a fast folding protein was one that folded in milliseconds.
There were, moreover, no analytical theoretical models and no atomistic
or coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to describe the mechanism.
Two of the most important discoveries from my lab since then are a
protein that folds in hundreds of nanoseconds, as determined from
nanosecond laser temperature experiments, and the discovery that the
theoretically predicted barrier crossing time is about the same for
proteins that differ in folding rates by 104-fold, as determined
from single molecule fluorescence measurements. We also developed
what has been called the “Hückel model” of protein
folding, which quantitatively explains a wide range of equilibrium
and kinetic measurements. This retrospective traces the history of
contributions to the “fast folding” subfield from my
lab until about 3 years ago, when I left protein folding to spend
the rest of my research career trying to discover an inexpensive drug
for treating sickle cell disease.},

However, while this task has been investigated for over 50 years, very little is known about its mechanisms of action. Moreover, the identification of regions involved in aggregation is still an open problem and the state-of-the-art methods are often inadequate in real case applications.In this article we present AgMata, an unsupervised tool for the identification of such regions from amino acidic sequence based on a generalized definition of statistical potentials that includes biophysical information. The tool outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two different benchmarks. As case-study, we applied our tool to human ataxin-3, a protein involved in Machado–Joseph disease. Interestingly, AgMata identifies aggregation-prone residues that share the very same structural environment. Additionally, it successfully predicts the outcome of in vitro mutagenesis experiments, identifying point mutations that lead to an alteration of the aggregation propensity of the wild-type ataxin-3.A python implementation of the tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/bio2byte/agmata.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins (PSPs) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in PSPs research.Here we present PSPer, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like RNA-binding PSPs. We show that it can prioritize PSPs among proteins containing similar RNA-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. PSPer is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely PSPs for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.PSPer is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The primary data to determine when studying proteins are the per-atom NMR chemical shifts, which reflect the local environment of atoms and provide insights into amino acid residue dynamics and conformation. Within an amino acid residue, chemical shifts present multi-dimensional and complexly cross-correlated information, making them difficult to analyse. The ShiftCrypt method, based on neural network auto-encoder architecture, compresses the per-amino acid chemical shift information in a single, interpretable, amino acid-type independent value that reflects the biophysical state of a residue. We here present the ShiftCrypt web server, which makes the method readily available. The server accepts chemical shifts input files in the NMR Exchange Format (NEF) or NMR-STAR format, executes ShiftCrypt and visualises the results, which are also accessible via an API. It also enables the ”biophysically-based” pairwise alignment of two proteins based on their ShiftCrypt values. This approach uses Dynamic Time Warping and can optionally include their amino acid code information, and has applications in, for example, the alignment of disordered regions.

We defined at near‐residue resolution hierarchical folding initiated by similar foldons in the twins, at different order and rates. PpiA folding is delayed by less hydrophobic native contacts, frustrated residues and a $\beta$‐turn in the earliest foldon and by signal peptide‐mediated disruption of foldon hierarchy. When selected PpiA residues and/or its signal peptide were grafted onto PpiB, they converted it into a slow folder with enhanced in vivo secretion. These structural adaptations in a secretory protein facilitate trafficking., Comparison between a slow‐folding secreted bacterial protein (PpiA) and its fast‐folding cytosolic homologue (PpiB) offers insights into structural features that regulate protein folding.},

However, a significant part of the proteome shows highly dynamic and/or structurally ambiguous behavior, which cannot be correctly represented by the traditional fixed set of static coordinates. Representing such protein behaviors remains challenging, and necessarily involves a complex interpretation of conformational states, including probabilistic descriptions. Relating protein dynamics and multiple conformations to their function as well as their physiological context (e.g., post-translational modifications, subcellular localization) therefore remains elusive for much of the proteome, with studies to investigate the effect of protein dynamics relying heavily on computational models. We here investigate the possibility of delineating three classes of protein conformational behavior: order, disorder and ambiguous. These definitions are explored based on three different datasets, using interpretable machine learning from a set of features, from AlphaFold2 to sequence-based predictions, to understand the overlap and differences between these datasets. This forms the basis for a discussion on the current limitations in describing the behavior of dynamic and ambiguous proteins.},

	abstract = {The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond–nanosecond local and microsecond–millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.},

We employ this method to characterize the folding reaction of a three-domain protein, adenylate kinase. Using thousands of single-molecule trajectories and hidden Markov modelling, we identify six metastable states on adenylate kinase's folding landscape. Remarkably, the connectivity of the intermediates depends on denaturant concentration; at low concentration, multiple intersecting folding pathways co-exist. We anticipate that the methodology introduced here will find broad applicability in the study of folding of large proteins, and will provide a more realistic scenario of their conformational dynamics.},

We performed an international blind study involving 19 laboratories to assess the uncertainty of {FRET} experiments for proteins with respect to the measured {FRET} efficiency histograms, determination of distances, and the detection and quantification of structural dynamics. Using two protein systems with distinct conformational changes and dynamics, we obtained an uncertainty of the {FRET} efficiency ≤0.06, corresponding to an interdye distance precision of ≤2 Å and accuracy of ≤5 Å. We further discuss the limits for detecting fluctuations in this distance range and how to identify dye perturbations. Our work demonstrates the ability of {smFRET} experiments to simultaneously measure distances and avoid the averaging of conformational dynamics for realistic protein systems, highlighting its importance in the expanding toolbox of integrative structural biology.},

However, most NMR methods require a detailed knowledge of the 3D structure and/or the collection of additional experimental data (NOEs, T1, T2, etc.) to accurately measure protein dynamics. Here we present a simple method based on chemical shift data that allows accurate, quantitative, site-specific mapping of protein backbone mobility without the need of a three-dimensional structure or the collection and analysis of NMR relaxation data. Further, we show that this chemical shift method is able to quantitatively predict per-residue RMSD values (from both MD simulations and NMR structural ensembles) as well as model-free backbone order parameters.},

NMR spectroscopy has long been used to provide insights into the motions of side-chain groups. Currently, the method of choice for studying side-chain dynamics by NMR is the measurement of methyl 2H autorelaxation. Methyl 2H autorelaxation exhibits simple relaxation mechanisms and can be straightforwardly converted to meaningful dynamic parameters. However, methyl groups can only be found in 6 of 19 side-chain bearing amino acids. Consequently, only a sparse assessment of protein side-chain dynamics is possible. Therefore, there is a significant interest in developing novel methods of studying side-chain motions that can be applied to all types of side-chains. Here, we show how side-chain chemical shifts can be used to determine the magnitude of fast side-chain motions in proteins. The chemical shift method is applicable to all side-chain bearing residues and does not require any additional measurements beyond standard NMR experiments for backbone and side-chain assignments.},

They contain a mixture of information, encompassing the in-solution conformations a protein adopts, as well as the movements it performs. Due to their intrinsically multi-faceted nature, CS are difficult to interpret and visualize. Classical approaches for the analysis of CS aim to extract specific protein-related properties, thus discarding a large amount of information that cannot be directly linked to structural features of the protein. Here we propose an autoencoder-based method, called ShiftCrypt, that provides a way to analyze, compare and interpret CS in their native, multidimensional space. We show that ShiftCrypt conserves information about the most common structural features. In addition, it can be used to identify hidden similarities between diverse proteins and peptides, and differences between the same protein in two different binding states.},

Alternatively, a slower but slightly more accurate ESpritz variant using sequence profiles can be used for applications requiring maximum performance. Two levels of prediction confidence allow either to maximize reasonable disorder detection or to limit expected false positives to 5\%. ESpritz performs consistently well on the recent CASP9 data, reaching a S(w) measure of 54.82 and area under the receiver operator curve of 0.856. The fast predictor is four orders of magnitude faster and remains better than most publicly available CASP9 methods, making it ideal for genomic scale predictions.CONCLUSIONS:ESpritz predicts three flavors of disorder at two distinct false positive rates, either with a fast or slower and slightly more accurate approach. Given its state-of-the-art performance, it can be especially useful for high-throughput applications.AVAILABILITY:Both a web server for high-throughput analysis and a Linux executable version of ESpritz are available from: http://protein.bio.unipd.it/espritz/.},

	abstract = {The public archives containing protein information in the form of NMR chemical shift data at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) and of 3D structure coordinates at the Protein Data Bank are continuously expanding. The quality of the data contained in these archives, however, varies. The main issue for chemical shift values is that they are determined relative to a reference frequency. When this reference frequency is set incorrectly, all related chemical shift values are systematically offset. Such wrongly referenced chemical shift values, as well as other problems such as chemical shift values that are assigned to the wrong atom, are not easily distinguished from correct values and effectively reduce the usefulness of the archive. We describe a new method to correct and validate protein chemical shift values in relation to their 3D structure coordinates. This method classifies atoms using two parameters: the per-atom solvent accessible surface area (as calculated from the coordinates) and the secondary structure of the parent amino acid. Through the use of Gaussian statistics based on a large database of 3220 BMRB entries, we obtain per-entry chemical shift corrections as well as Z scores for the individual chemical shift values. In addition, information on the error of the correction value itself is available, and the method can retain only dependable correction values. We provide an online resource with chemical shift, atom exposure, and secondary structure information for all relevant BMRB entries (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/nmr/vasco) and hope this data will aid the development of new chemical shift-based methods in NMR.

The new database schema gives more flexibility for the users, as well as simplifying the maintenance and updates. In addition, the new entry page provides more visualisation tools including customizable feature viewer and graphs of the residue contact maps. MobiDB v4 annotates the binding modes of disordered proteins, whether they undergo disorder-to-order transitions or remain disordered in the bound state. In addition, disordered regions undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation or post-translational modifications are defined. The integrated information is presented in a simplified interface, which enables faster searches and allows large customized datasets to be downloaded in TSV, Fasta or JSON formats. An alternative advanced interface allows users to drill deeper into features of interest. A new statistics page provides information at database and proteome levels.

Three times more sequences are captured in FunFams, with a concomitant increase in functional purity, information content and structural coverage. FunFam expansion increases the structural annotations provided for experimental GO terms (+59\%). We also present CATH-FunVar web-pages displaying variations in protein sequences and their proximity to known or predicted functional sites.

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.}",

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C$\alpha$ positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted $\beta$-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues.

	abstract = {Abstract Geometrical validation around the C$\alpha$ is described, with a new C? measure and updated Ramachandran plot. Deviation of the observed C? atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure-validation information contained in bond angle distortions. C? deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. A new ?,? plot using density-dependent smoothing for 81,234 non-Gly, non-Pro, and non-{prePro} residues with B {\textless} 30 from 500 high-resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. One such region is the ?-turn conformation near +75°,?60°, counted as forbidden by common structure-validation programs; however, it occurs in well-ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the ?-turn H-bond. Favored and allowed ?,? regions are also defined for Pro, pre-Pro, and Gly (important because Gly ?,? angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). Details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of $\alpha$-helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. A proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two-peptide {NHs} permits donating only a single H-bond. New calculations by Hu et al. [Proteins 2002 (this issue)] for Ala and Gly dipeptides, using mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, fit our nonrepetitive data in excellent detail.

The new version, PED 4.0, has been completely redesigned and reimplemented with cutting-edge technology and now holds about six times more data (162 versus 24 entries and 242 versus 60 structural ensembles) and a broader representation of state of the art ensemble generation methods than the previous version. The database has a completely renewed graphical interface with an interactive feature viewer for region-based annotations, and provides a series of descriptors of the qualitative and quantitative properties of the ensembles. High quality of the data is guaranteed by a new submission process, which combines both automatic and manual evaluation steps. A team of biocurators integrate structured metadata describing the ensemble generation methodology, experimental constraints and conditions. A new search engine allows the user to build advanced queries and search all entry fields including cross-references to IDP-related resources such as DisProt, MobiDB, BMRB and SASBDB. We expect that the renewed PED will be useful for researchers interested in the atomic-level understanding of IDP function, and promote the rational, structure-based design of IDP-targeting drugs.}",

	abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein whose aggregation is implicated in Parkinson’s disease. A second member of the synuclein family, $\beta$-synuclein, shares significant sequence similarity with $\alpha$-synuclein but is much more resistant to aggregation. $\beta$-Synuclein is missing an 11-residue stretch in the central non-$\beta$-amyloid component region that forms the core of $\alpha$-synuclein amyloid fibrils, yet insertion of these residues into $\beta$-synuclein to produce the $\beta$SHC construct does not markedly increase the aggregation propensity. To investigate the structural basis of these different behaviors, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance data, in the form of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement-derived interatomic distances, are combined with molecular dynamics simulations to generate ensembles of structures representative of the solution states of $\alpha$-synuclein, $\beta$-synuclein, and $\beta$SHC. Comparison of these ensembles reveals that the differing aggregation propensities of $\alpha$-synuclein and $\beta$-synuclein are associated with differences in the degree of residual structure in the C-terminus coupled to the shorter separation between the N- and C-termini in $\beta$-synuclein and $\beta$SHC, making protective intramolecular contacts more likely.},

	abstract = {The synuclein family of intrinsically unfolded proteins is composed of three highly homologous members, alpha-synuclein (alphaS), beta-synuclein (betaS) and gamma-synuclein (gammaS), which are linked to neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. alphaS has been studied intensively after its identification as the major protein component of amyloid-like deposits in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. betaS, on the other hand, was found to act as a potent inhibitor of alphaS amyloid formation, and it is proposed as a natural regulator of its neurotoxicity. It is then of particular interest to elucidate the structural and dynamic features of the soluble state of betaS as a first step to understand the molecular basis of its anti-amyloidogenic effect on alphaS. We present here the characterization of natively unstructured betaS by high resolution heteronuclear NMR techniques. A combination of pulse-field gradient, three-dimensional heteronuclear correlation, residual dipolar couplings, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement and backbone relaxation experiments were employed to characterize the ensemble of conformations populated by the protein. The results indicate that betaS adopts extended conformations in its native state, characterized by the lack of the long-range contacts as previously reported for alphaS. Despite the lack of defined secondary structure, we found evidence for transient polyproline II conformations clustered at the C-terminal region. The structuring of the backbone at the C terminus is locally encoded, stabilized by the presence of eight proline residues embedded in a polypeptide stretch rich in hydrophilic and negatively charged amino acids. The structural and functional implications of these findings are analyzed via a thorough comparison with its neurotoxic homolog alphaS.},

The most successful protein structure prediction methods make use of a divide-and-conquer strategy to attack the problem: a conformational sampling method generates plausible candidate structures, which are subsequently accepted or rejected using an energy function. Conceptually, this often corresponds to separating local structural bias from the long-range interactions that stabilize the compact, native state. However, sampling protein conformations that are compatible with the local structural bias encoded in a given protein sequence is a long-standing open problem, especially in continuous space. We describe an elegant and mathematically rigorous method to do this, and show that it readily generates native-like protein conformations simply by enforcing compactness.

Computational methods play important roles in the characterization of IDRs. One of the commonly used disorder prediction methods is IUPred, which relies on an energy estimation approach. The IUPred web server takes an amino acid sequence or a Uniprot ID/accession as an input and predicts the tendency for each amino acid to be in a disordered region with an option to also predict context-dependent disordered regions. In this new iteration of IUPred, we added multiple novel features to enhance the prediction capabilities of the server. First, learning from the latest evaluation of disorder prediction methods we introduced multiple new smoothing functions to the prediction that decreases noise and increases the performance of the predictions. We constructed a dataset consisting of experimentally verified ordered/disordered regions with unambiguous annotations which were added to the prediction. We also introduced a novel tool that enables the exploration of the evolutionary conservation of protein disorder coupled to sequence conservation in model organisms.

            It is commonly thought that each globular protein has a single 3D structure, or fold, that fosters its function. In contrast, recent studies have identified several fold-switching proteins whose secondary structures can be remodeled in response to cellular stimuli. Although thought to be rare, we found 96 literature-validated fold-switching proteins by exhaustively searching the database of protein structures [Protein Data Bank ({PDB})]. Characterizing these proteins led us to hypothesize that their abundance may be underrepresented in the {PDB}. Thus, we developed a computational method that identifies fold-switching proteins and used it to estimate that 0.5–4\% of {PDB} proteins switch folds. These results suggest that proteins switch folds with significant frequency, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.
          , 
            A central tenet of biology is that globular proteins have a unique 3D structure under physiological conditions. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that some proteins switch folds, a process that involves remodeling of secondary structure in response to a few mutations (evolved fold switchers) or cellular stimuli (extant fold switchers). To date, extant fold switchers have been viewed as rare byproducts of evolution, but their frequency has been neither quantified nor estimated. By systematically and exhaustively searching the Protein Data Bank ({PDB}), we found ∼100 extant fold-switching proteins. Furthermore, we gathered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these proteins are widespread in nature. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesized that the frequency of extant fold-switching proteins may be underrepresented by the structures in the {PDB}. Thus, we sought to identify other putative extant fold switchers with only one solved conformation. To do this, we identified two characteristic features of our ∼100 extant fold-switching proteins, incorrect secondary structure predictions and likely independent folding cooperativity, and searched the {PDB} for other proteins with similar features. Reassuringly, this method identified dozens of other proteins in the literature with indication of a structural change but only one solved conformation in the {PDB}. Thus, we used it to estimate that 0.5–4\% of {PDB} proteins switch folds. These results demonstrate that extant fold-switching proteins are likely more common than the {PDB} reflects, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.},

            Deep-learning (DL) methods like DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 (AF2) have led to substantial improvements in protein structure prediction. We analyse confident AF2 models from 21 model organisms using a new classification protocol (CATH-Assign) which exploits novel DL methods for structural comparison and classification. Of {\textasciitilde}370,000 confident models, 92\% can be assigned to 3253 superfamilies in our CATH domain superfamily classification. The remaining cluster into 2367 putative novel superfamilies. Detailed manual analysis on 618 of these, having at least one human relative, reveal extremely remote homologies and further unusual features. Only 25 novel superfamilies could be confirmed. Although most models map to existing superfamilies, AF2 domains expand CATH by 67\% and increases the number of unique ‘global’ folds by 36\% and will provide valuable insights on structure function relationships. CATH-Assign will harness the huge expansion in structural data provided by DeepMind to rationalise evolutionary changes driving functional divergence.},

By leveraging the recent deep learning revolution in protein bioinformatics, we can now shed light into uncharted areas of the protein universe at an unprecedented scale, paving the way to innovations in life sciences and biotechnology.},

Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.},

	abstract = {The family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest protein families in the human genome. GPCRs transduct chemical signals from extracellular to intracellular regions via a conformational switch between active and inactive states upon ligand binding. While experimental structures of GPCRs remain limited, high-accuracy computational predictions are now possible with AlphaFold2. However, AlphaFold2 only predicts one state and is biased toward either the active or inactive conformation depending on the GPCR class. Here, a multi-state prediction protocol is introduced that extends AlphaFold2 to predict either active or inactive states at very high accuracy using state-annotated templated GPCR databases. The predicted models accurately capture the main structural changes upon activation of the GPCR at the atomic level. For most of the benchmarked GPCRs (10 out of 15), models in the active and inactive states were closer to their corresponding activation state structures. Median RMSDs of the transmembrane regions were 1.12 Å and 1.41 Å for the active and inactive state models, respectively. The models were more suitable for protein-ligand docking than the original AlphaFold2 models and template-based models. Finally, our prediction protocol predicted accurate GPCR structures and GPCR-peptide complex structures in GPCR Dock 2021, a blind GPCR-ligand complex modeling competition. We expect that high accuracy GPCR models in both activation states will promote understanding in GPCR activation mechanisms and drug discovery for GPCRs. At the time, the new protocol paves the way towards capturing the dynamics of proteins at high-accuracy via machine-learning methods.},

	abstract = {AlphaFold2 (ref. 1) has revolutionized structural biology by accurately predicting single structures of proteins. However, a protein’s biological function often depends on multiple conformational substates2, and disease-causing point mutations often cause population changes within these substates3,4. We demonstrate that clustering a multiple-sequence alignment by sequence similarity enables AlphaFold2 to sample alternative states of known metamorphic proteins with high confidence. Using this method, named AF-Cluster, we investigated the evolutionary distribution of predicted structures for the metamorphic protein KaiB5 and found that predictions of both conformations were distributed in clusters across the KaiB family. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to confirm an AF-Cluster prediction: a cyanobacteria KaiB variant is stabilized in the opposite state compared with the more widely studied variant. To test AF-Cluster’s sensitivity to point mutations, we designed and experimentally verified a set of three mutations predicted to flip KaiB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides from the ground to the fold-switched state. Finally, screening for alternative states in protein families without known fold switching identified a putative alternative state for the oxidoreductase Mpt53 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further development of such bioinformatic methods in tandem with experiments will probably have a considerable impact on predicting protein energy landscapes, essential for illuminating biological function.},

These methods are also used to extract the essential information from large simulation datasets and to enhance the sampling of rare events such as folding/unfolding transitions. While significant challenges still need to be tackled, we expect these methods to play an important role on the study of protein folding and dynamics in the near future.

Conventional similarity measures based on a global superposition of carbon $\alpha$ atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model., Results: The Local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) is a superposition-free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of stereochemical plausibility. The reference can be a single structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. We demonstrate that lDDT is well suited to assess local model quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while maintaining good correlation with global measures. These properties make lDDT a robust tool for the automated assessment of structure prediction servers without manual intervention., Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries for Linux and MacOSX, and an interactive web server are available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/lddt, Contact:

            Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) defying the traditional protein structure–function paradigm have been difficult to analyze. The availability of accurate structure predictions on a large scale in AlphaFoldDB offers a fresh perspective on IDR prediction. Here, we establish three baselines for IDR prediction from AlphaFoldDB models based on the recent CAID dataset. Surprisingly, AlphaFoldDB is highly competitive for predicting both IDRs and conditionally folded binding regions, demonstrating the plasticity of the disorder to structure continuum.},

Owing to the inherent flexibility of IDPs, solution techniques are particularly appropriate for characterizing their biophysical properties, and structural ensembles in agreement with these data provide a convenient tool for describing the underlying conformational sampling. Database entries consist of (i) primary experimental data with descriptions of the acquisition methods and algorithms used for the ensemble calculations, and (ii) the structural ensembles consistent with these data, provided as a set of models in a Protein Data Bank format. PE-DB is open for submissions from the community, and is intended as a forum for disseminating the structural ensembles and the methodologies used to generate them. While the need to represent the IDP structures is clear, methods for determining and evaluating the structural ensembles are still evolving. The availability of the pE-DB database is expected to promote the development of new modeling methods and leads to a better understanding of how function arises from disordered states.},

	abstract = {The backbone dynamics of Ca2+-saturated recombinant Drosophila calmodulin has been studied by 15N longitudinal and transverse relaxation experiments, combined with 15N\{*H\} NOE measurements. Results indicate a high degree of mobility near the middle of the central helix of calmodulin, from residue K77 through S81, with order parameters (S2) in the 0.5-0.6 range. The anisotropy observed in the motion of the two globular calmodulin domains is much smaller than expected on the basis of hydrodynamic calculations for a rigid dumbbell type structure. This indicates that, for the purposes of 15N relaxation, the tumbling of the N-terminal (L4-K77) and C-terminal (E82-S147) lobes of calmodulin is effectively independent. A slightly shorter motional correlation time (rc = 6.3 ns) is obtained for the C-terminal domain compared to the N-terminal domain (rc «= 7.1 ns), in agreement with the smaller size of the C-terminal domain. A high degree of mobility, with order parameters of {\textasciitilde}0.5, is also observed in the loop that connects the first with the second EF-hand type calcium binding domain and in the loop connecting the third and fourth calcium binding domain.},

	abstract = {NMR spectroscopy is a key technique for understanding the behaviour of proteins, especially highly dynamic proteins that adopt multiple conformations in solution. Overall, protein structures determined from NMR spectroscopy data constitute just over 10\% of the Protein Data Bank archive. This review covers the validation of these NMR protein structures, but rather than describing currently available methodology, it focuses on concepts that are important for understanding where and how validation is most relevant. First, the inherent characteristics of the protein under study have an influence on quality and quantity of the distinct types of data that can be acquired from NMR experiments. Second, these NMR data are necessarily transformed into a model for use in a structure calculation protocol, and the protein structures that result from this reflect the types of NMR data used as well as the protein characteristics. The validation of NMR protein structures should therefore take account, wherever possible, of the inherent behavioural characteristics of the protein, the types of available NMR data, and the calculation protocol. These concepts are discussed in the context of ‘knowledge based’ and ‘model versus data’ validation, with suggestions for questions to ask and different validation categories to consider. The principal aim of this review is to stimulate discussion and to help the reader understand the relationships between the above elements in order to make informed decisions on which validation approaches are the most relevant in particular cases.},

	abstract = {The single alpha helix (SAH) is a recurring motif in biology. The consensus sequence has a di-block architecture that includes repeats of four consecutive glutamate residues followed by four consecutive lysine residues. Measurements show that the overall helicity of sequences with consensus E4K4 repeats is insensitive to a wide range of pH values. Here, we use the recently introduced q-canonical ensemble, which allows us to decouple measurements of charge state and conformation, to explain the observed insensitivity of SAH helicity to pH. We couple the outputs from separate measurements of charge and conformation with atomistic simulations to derive residue-specific quantifications of preferences for being in an alpha helix and for the ionizable residues to be charged vs. uncharged. We find a clear preference for accommodating uncharged Glu residues within internal positions of SAH-forming sequences. The stabilities of alpha helical conformations increase with the number of E4K4 repeats and so do the numbers of accessible charge states that are compatible with forming conformations of high helical content. There is conformational buffering whereby charge state heterogeneity buffers against large-scale conformational changes thus making the overall helicity insensitive to large changes in pH. Further, the results clearly argue against a single, rod-like alpha helical conformation being the only or even dominant conformation in the ensembles of so-called SAH sequences.},

	abstract = {The topology of $\beta$-sheets is defined by the pattern of hydrogen-bonded strand pairing. Therefore, predicting hydrogen bonded strand partners is a fundamental step towards predicting $\beta$-sheet topology. At the same time, finding the correct partners is very difficult due to long range interactions involved in strand pairing. Additionally, patterns of aminoacids observed in $\beta$-sheet formations are very general and therefore difficult to use for computational recognition of specific contacts between strands. In this work, we report a new strand pairing algorithm. To address above mentioned difficulties, our algorithm attempts to mimic elements of the folding process. Namely, in addition to ensuring that the predicted hydrogen bonded strand pairs satisfy basic global consistency constraints, it takes into account hypothetical folding pathways. Consistently with this view, introducing hydrogen bonds between a pair of strands changes the probabilities of forming hydrogen bonds between other pairs of strand. We demonstrate that this approach provides an improvement over previously proposed algorithms. We also compare the performance of this method to that of a global optimization algorithm that poses the problem as integer linear programming optimization problem and solves it using ILOG CPLEX™ package.},

We introduce a Bayesian approach for proteins with six or less  -strands in which we model the conformational features in a probabilistic framework by combining the amino acid pairing potentials with a priori knowledge of  -strand organizations. To select the optimum  -sheet architecture, we significantly reduce the search space by heuristics that enforce the amino acid pairs with strong interaction potentials. In addition, we find the optimum pairwise alignment between  -strands using dynamic programming in which we allow any number of gaps in an alignment to model  -bulges more effectively. For proteins with more than six  -strands, we first compute  -strand pairings using the BetaPro method. Then, we compute gapped alignments of the paired  -strands and choose the interaction types and  -residue pairings with maximum alignment scores. We performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the BetaSheet916 set and obtained significant improvements in the prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental events in protein folding is $\alpha$-helix formation, which involves sequential development of a series of helical hydrogen bonds between the backbone C=O group of residues i and the –NH group of residues i + 4. While we now know a great deal about $\alpha$-helix folding dynamics, a key question that remains to be answered is where the productive helical nucleation event occurs. Statistically, a helical nucleus (or the first helical hydrogen-bond) can form anywhere within the peptide sequence in question; however, the one that leads to productive folding may only form at a preferred location. This consideration is based on the fact that the $\alpha$-helical structure is inherently asymmetric, due to the specific alignment of the helical hydrogen bonds. While this hypothesis is plausible, validating it is challenging because there is not an experimental observable that can be used to directly pinpoint the location of the productive nucleation process. Therefore, in this study we combine several techniques, including peptide cross-linking, laser-induced temperature-jump infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, to tackle this challenge. Taken together, our experimental and simulation results support an $\alpha$-helix folding mechanism wherein the productive nucleus is formed at the N-terminus, which propagates toward the C-terminal end of the peptide to yield the folded structure. In addition, our results show that incorporation of a cross-linker can lead to formation of differently folded conformations, underscoring the need for all-atom simulations to quantitatively assess the proposed cross-linking design.,},

	abstract = {The understanding of fast folding dynamics of single $\alpha$-helices comes mostly from studies on rationally designed peptides displaying sequences with high helical propensity. The folding/unfolding dynamics and energetics of $\alpha$-helix conformations in naturally occurring peptides remains largely unexplored. Here we report the study of a protein fragment analogue of the C-peptide from bovine pancreatic ribonuclease-A, RN80, a 13-amino acid residue peptide that adopts a highly populated helical conformation in aqueous solution. 1H NMR and CD structural studies of RN80 showed that $\alpha$-helix formation displays a pH-dependent bell-shaped curve, with a maximum near pH 5, and a large decrease in helical content in alkaline pH. The main forces stabilizing this short $\alpha$-helix were identified as a salt bridge formed between Glu-2 and Arg-10 and the cation−π interaction involving Tyr-8 and His-12. Thus, deprotonation of Glu-2 or protonation of His-12 are essential for the RN80 $\alpha$-helix stability. In the present study, RN80 folding and unfolding were triggered by laser-induced pH jumps and detected by time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry (PAC). The photoacid proton release, amino acid residue protonation, and unfolding/folding events occur at different time scales and were clearly distinguished using time-resolved PAC. The partial unfolding of the RN80 $\alpha$-helix, due to protonation of Glu-2 and consequent breaking of the stabilizing salt bridge between Glu-2 and Arg-10, is characterized by a concentration-independent volume expansion in the sub-microsecond time range (0.8 mL mol–1, 369 ns). This small volume expansion reports the cost of peptide backbone rehydration upon disruption of a solvent-exposed salt bridge, as well as backbone intrinsic expansion. On the other hand, RN80 $\alpha$-helix folding triggered by His-12 protonation and subsequent formation of a cation−π interaction leads to a microsecond volume contraction (−6.0 mL mol–1, ∼1.7 μs). The essential role of two discrete side chain interactions, a salt bridge, and in particular a single cation−π interaction in the folding dynamics of a naturally occurring $\alpha$-helix peptide is uniquely revealed by these data.},

	abstract = {The thermal melting of a dicyclic 29-residue peptide, having helix-stabilizing side-chain to side-chain covalent links at each terminal, has been studied by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The CD spectra for this dicyclic peptide indicate that it is monomeric, almost fully $\alpha$-helical at −10 °C, and undergoes a reversible transition from the folded to the disordered state with increasing temperature. The temperature dependencies of the ellipticity at 222 nm and the excess heat capacity measured calorimetrically are well fit by a two-state model, which indicates a cooperative melting transition that is complete within the temperature ranges of these experiments (from −10 °C to 100 °C). This allows a complete analysis of the thermodynamics of helix formation. The helix unfolding is found to proceed with a small positive heat-capacity increment, consistent with the solvation of some non-polar groups upon helix unfolding. It follows that the hydrogen bonds are not the only factors responsible for the formation of the $\alpha$-helix, and that hydrophobic interactions are also playing a role in its stabilization. At 30 °C, the calorimetric enthalpy and entropy values are estimated to be 650(±50) cal mol−1 and 2.0(±0.2) cal K−1mole−1, respectively, per residue of this peptide. Comparison with the thermodynamic characteristics obtained for the unfolding of double-stranded $\alpha$-helical coiled-coils shows that at that temperature the enthalpic contribution of non-polar groups to the stabilization of the $\alpha$-helix is insignificant and the estimated transition enthalpy can be assigned to the hydrogen bonds. With increasing temperature, the increasing magnitude of the negative enthalpy of hydration of the exposed polar groups should decrease the helix-stabilizing enthalpy of the backbone hydrogen bonds. However, the helix-stabilizing negative entropy of hydration of these groups should also increase in magnitude with increasing temperature, offsetting this effect.},

	abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of data on human genetic variation has resulted in a growing demand to identify pathogenic mutations computationally, as their experimental validation is currently beyond reach. Here we show that alpha helices and beta strands differ significantly in their ability to tolerate mutations: helices can accumulate more mutations than strands without change, due to the higher numbers of inter-residue contacts in helices. This results in two patterns: a) the same number of mutations causes less structural change in helices than in strands; b) helices diverge more rapidly in sequence than strands within the same domains. Additionally, both helices and strands are significantly more robust than coils. Based on this observation we show that human missense mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic than those that do not. Moreover, inclusion of predicted secondary structure changes shows significant utility for improving upon state-of-the-art pathogenicity predictions., The factors that determine the robustness and evolvability of proteins are still largely unknown. In this work the authors show that different secondary structure elements of proteins (helices and strands) differ in their ability to tolerate mutations, and demonstrate that it is caused by differences in the number of non-covalent residue interactions within these secondary structure units. The results suggest that engineering de novo all-alpha proteins should be easier than all-beta ones, as more sequences can to fold to the same topology. Additionally, secondary structure can be used to improve current methods of pathogenicity predictions; mutations that change secondary structure are more likely to be pathogenic than mutations that do not, due to their strong destabilizing effect on protein structure.},

	abstract = {After the outstanding breakthrough of AlphaFold in predicting protein 3D models, new questions appeared and remain unanswered. The ensemble nature of proteins, for example, challenges the structural prediction methods because the models should represent a set of conformers instead of single structures. The evolutionary and structural features captured by effective deep learning techniques may unveil the information to generate several diverse conformations from a single sequence. Here, we address the performance of AlphaFold2 predictions obtained through ColabFold under this ensemble paradigm.Using a curated collection of apo–holo pairs of conformers, we found that AlphaFold2 predicts the holo form of a protein in ∼70\% of the cases, being unable to reproduce the observed conformational diversity with the same error for both conformers. More importantly, we found that AlphaFold2's performance worsens with the increasing conformational diversity of the studied protein. This impairment is related to the heterogeneity in the degree of conformational diversity found between different members of the homologous family of the protein under study. Finally, we found that main-chain flexibility associated with apo–holo pairs of conformers negatively correlates with the predicted local model quality score plDDT, indicating that plDDT values in a single 3D model could be used to infer local conformational changes linked to ligand binding transitions.Data and code used in this manuscript are publicly available at https://gitlab.com/sbgunq/publications/af2confdiv-oct2021.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The crystal structure of the Grp1 Sec7-PH tandem reveals a pseudosubstrate mechanism of autoinhibition in which the linker region between domains and a C-terminal amphipathic helix physically block the docking sites for the switch regions of Arf GTPases. Mutations within either element result in partial or complete activation. Critical determinants of autoinhibition also contribute to insulin-stimulated plasma membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition can be largely reversed by binding of active Arf6 to Grp1 and by phosphorylation of tandem PKC sites in Cytohesin-1.

	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular modeling of protein structures are changing the field of structural biology. AlphaFold-2 (AF2), an AI system developed by DeepMind, Inc., utilizes attention-based deep learning to predict models of protein structures with high accuracy relative to structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). Comparing AF2 models to structures determined using solution NMR data, both high similarities and distinct differences have been observed. Since AF2 was trained on X-ray crystal and cryoEM structures, we assessed how accurately AF2 can model small, monomeric, solution protein NMR structures which (i) were not used in the AF2 training data set, and (ii) did not have homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank at the time of AF2 training. We identified nine open-source protein NMR data sets for such “blind” targets, including chemical shift, raw NMR FID data, NOESY peak lists, and (for 1 case) 15N-1H residual dipolar coupling data. For these nine small (70–108 residues) monomeric proteins, we generated AF2 prediction models and assessed how well these models fit to these experimental NMR data, using several well-established NMR structure validation tools. In most of these cases, the AF2 models fit the NMR data nearly as well, or sometimes better than, the corresponding NMR structure models previously deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These results provide benchmark NMR data for assessing new NMR data analysis and protein structure prediction methods. They also document the potential for using AF2 as a guiding tool in protein NMR data analysis, and more generally for hypothesis generation in structural biology research.},

	abstract = {AlphaFold2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction by leveraging sequence information to rapidly model protein folds with atomic-level accuracy. Nevertheless, previous work has shown that these predictions tend to be inaccurate for structurally heterogeneous proteins. To systematically assess factors that contribute to this inaccuracy, we tested AlphaFold2's performance on 98-fold-switching proteins, which assume at least two distinct-yet-stable secondary and tertiary structures. Topological similarities were quantified between five predicted and two experimentally determined structures of each fold-switching protein. Overall, 94\% of AlphaFold2 predictions captured one experimentally determined conformation but not the other. Despite these biased results, AlphaFold2's estimated confidences were moderate-to-high for 74\% of fold-switching residues, a result that contrasts with overall low confidences for intrinsically disordered proteins, which are also structurally heterogeneous. To investigate factors contributing to this disparity, we quantified sequence variation within the multiple sequence alignments used to generate AlphaFold2's predictions of fold-switching and intrinsically disordered proteins. Unlike intrinsically disordered regions, whose sequence alignments show low conservation, fold-switching regions had conservation rates statistically similar to canonical single-fold proteins. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions had systematically lower prediction confidences than either fold-switching or single-fold proteins, regardless of sequence conservation. AlphaFold2's high prediction confidences for fold switchers indicate that it uses sophisticated pattern recognition to search for one most probable conformer rather than protein biophysics to model a protein's structural ensemble. Thus, it is not surprising that its predictions often fail for proteins whose properties are not fully apparent from solved protein structures. Our results emphasize the need to look at protein structure as an ensemble and suggest that systematic examination of fold-switching sequences may reveal propensities for multiple stable secondary and tertiary structures.},

The latest version of DisProt brings significant advancements, including a broader representation of functions and an enhanced curation process. These improvements aim to increase both the quality of annotations and their coverage at the sequence level. Higher coverage has been achieved by adopting additional evidence codes. Quality of annotations has been improved by systematically applying Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) principles and reporting all the details of the experimental setup that could potentially influence the structural state of a protein. The DisProt database now includes new thematic datasets and has expanded the adoption of Gene Ontology terms, resulting in an extensive functional repertoire which is automatically propagated to UniProtKB. Finally, we show that DisProt's curated annotations strongly correlate with disorder predictions inferred from AlphaFold2 pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) confidence scores. This comparison highlights the utility of DisProt in explaining apparent uncertainty of certain well-defined predicted structures, which often correspond to folding-upon-binding fragments. Overall, DisProt serves as a comprehensive resource, combining experimental evidence of disorder information to enhance our understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins and their functional implications.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, molecular disorder has been viewed as local or global instability. Molecules or regions displaying disorder have been considered inherently unstructured. The term has been routinely applied to cases for which no atomic coordinates can be derived from crystallized molecules. Yet, even when it appears that the molecules are disordered, prevailing conformations exist, with population times higher than those of all alternate conformations. Disordered molecules are the outcome of rugged energy landscapes away from the native state around the bottom of the funnel. Ruggedness has a biological function, creating a distribution of structured conformers that bind via conformational selection, driving association and multimolecular complex formation, whether chain-linked in folding or unlinked in binding. We classify disordered molecules into two types. The first type possesses a hydrophobic core. Here, even if the native conformation is unstable, it still has a large enough population time, enabling its experimental detection. In the second type, no such hydrophobic core exists. Hence, the native conformations of molecules belonging to this category have shorter population times, hindering their experimental detection. Although there is a continuum of distribution of hydrophobic cores in proteins, an empirical, statistically based hydrophobicity function may be used as a guideline for distinguishing the two disordered molecule types. Furthermore, the two types relate to steps in the protein folding reaction. With respect to protein design, this leads us to propose that engineering-optimized specific electrostatic interactions to avoid electrostatic repulsion would reduce the type I disordered state, driving the molten globule (MG) → native (N) state. In contrast, for overcoming the type II disordered state, in addition to specific interactions, a stronger hydrophobic core is also indicated, leading to the denatured → MG → N state.

Sorting out the contribution of these mechanisms to any binding interaction remains a challenging task of general interest in biochemistry. Here we show that conformational selection is associated with a vast repertoire of kinetic behaviors, can never be disproved a priori as a mechanism of ligand binding, and is sufficient to explain the relaxation kinetics documented experimentally for a large number of systems. On the other hand, induced fit features a narrow spectrum of kinetic behaviors and can be disproved in many cases in which conformational selection offers the only possible explanation. This conclusion offers a paradigm shift in the analysis of relaxation kinetics, with conformational selection acquiring preeminence as a mechanism of ligand binding. The dominant role of conformational selection supports the emerging structural view of the macromolecule as a conformational ensemble from which the ligand selects the initial optimal fit to produce a biological response.},

	abstract = {Two competing and mutually exclusive mechanisms of ligand recognition – conformational selection and induced fit – have dominated our interpretation of ligand binding in biological macromolecules for almost six decades. Conformational selection posits the pre-existence of multiple conformations of the macromolecule from which the ligand selects the optimal one. Induced fit, on the other hand, postulates the existence of conformational rearrangements of the original conformation into an optimal one that are induced by binding of the ligand. In the former case, conformational transitions precede the binding event; in the latter, conformational changes follow the binding step. Kineticists have used a facile criterion to distinguish between the two mechanisms based on the dependence of the rate of relaxation to equilibrium, kobs, on the ligand concentration, [L]. A value of kobs decreasing hyperbolically with [L] has been seen as diagnostic of conformational selection, while a value of kobs increasing hyperbolically with [L] has been considered diagnostic of induced fit. However, this simple conclusion is only valid under the rather unrealistic assumption of conformational transitions being much slower than binding and dissociation events. In general, induced fit only produces values of kobs that increase with [L] but conformational selection is more versatile and is associated with values of kobs that increase with, decrease with or are independent of [L]. The richer repertoire of kinetic properties of conformational selection applies to kinetic mechanisms with single or multiple saturable relaxations and explains the behavior of nearly all experimental systems reported in the literature thus far. Conformational selection is always sufficient and often necessary to account for the relaxation kinetics of ligand binding to a biological macromolecule and is therefore an essential component of any binding mechanism. On the other hand, induced fit is never necessary and only sufficient in a few cases. Therefore, the long assumed importance and preponderance of induced fit as a mechanism of ligand binding should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Various small molecules present in biological systems can assist protein folding in vitro and are known as chemical chaperones. De novo design of chemical chaperones with higher activity than currently known examples is desirable to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation in multiple contexts. However, this development has been hindered by limited knowledge of their activities. It is thought that chemical chaperones are typically poor solvents for a protein backbone and hence facilitate native structure formation. However, it is unknown if different chemical chaperones can act differently to modulate folding energy landscapes. Using a model slow folding protein, double-mutant Maltose-binding protein (DM-MBP), we show that a canonical chemical chaperone, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), accelerates refolding by decreasing the flexibility of the refolding intermediate (RI). Among a number of small molecules that chaperone DM-MBP folding, proline and serine stabilize the transition state (TS) enthalpically, while trehalose behaves like TMAO and increases the rate of barrier crossing through nonenthalpic processes. We propose a two-group classification of chemical chaperones based upon their thermodynamic effect on RI and TS, which is also supported by single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies. Interestingly, for a different test protein, the molecular mechanisms of the two groups of chaperones are not conserved. This provides a glimpse into the complexity of chemical chaperoning activity of osmolytes. Future work would allow us to engineer synergism between the two classes to design more efficient chemical chaperones to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation problems.},

Diverse chaperone systems assist de novo protein folding and trafficking, the assembly of oligomeric complexes, and recovery from stress-induced unfolding. A fundamental function of molecular chaperones is to inhibit unproductive protein interactions by recognizing and protecting hydrophobic surfaces that are exposed during folding or following proteotoxic stress. Beyond this basic principle, it is now clear that chaperones can also actively and specifically accelerate folding reactions in an ATP-dependent manner. We focus on the bacterial Hsp70 and chaperonin systems as paradigms, and review recent work that has advanced our understanding of how these chaperones act as catalysts of protein folding.},

Biophysical characterization of four types of cofactor-binding proteins (with copper, flavin moiety, iron−sulfur cluster, and heme cofactors, respectively) provides the following insights. (1) The presence of the cofactor often stabilizes the native protein. (2) The cofactor has the ability to interact specifically with the unfolded polypeptide. (3) The presence of the cofactor is sometimes essential for the polypeptide to fold. (4) Coordination of the cofactor prior to polypeptide folding can dramatically accelerate formation of the functional protein.},

Since many such metals can interact specifically with their corresponding unfolded proteins in vitro, cofactor-binding prior to polypeptide folding may be a biological path to active metalloproteins. By interacting with the unfolded polypeptide, the metal may create local structure that initiates and directs the polypeptide-folding process. Here, we review recent literature that addresses the involvement of metals in protein-folding reactions in vitro. To date, the best characterized systems are simple one such as blue-copper proteins, heme-binding proteins, iron-sulfur-cluster proteins and synthetic metallopeptides. Taken together, the available data demonstrates that metals can play diverse roles: it is clear that many cofactors bind before polypeptide folding and influence the reaction; yet, some do not bind until a well-structured active site is formed. The significance of characterizing the effects of metals on protein conformational changes is underscored by the many human diseases that are directly linked to anomalous protein–metal interactions.},

Their design highlights the ability to convert electric signals into fluctuations of the magnetic field at very high frequencies, which is essential for the high-density storage demanded nowadays. Here, we twist this conventional use of tape heads to implement one in a magnetic tweezers design, which offers the unique capability of changing the force with a bandwidth of ∼10 kHz. We calibrate our instrument by developing an analytical expression that predicts the magnetic force acting on a superparamagnetic bead based on the Karlqvist approximation of the magnetic field created by a tape head. This theory is validated by measuring the force dependence of protein L unfolding/folding step sizes and the folding properties of the R3 talin domain. We demonstrate the potential of our instrument by carrying out millisecond-long quenches to capture the formation of the ephemeral molten globule state in protein L, which has never been observed before. Our instrument provides the capability of interrogating individual molecules under fast-changing forces with a control and resolution below a fraction of a piconewton, opening a range of force spectroscopy protocols to study protein dynamics under force.},

The technological development of transmission electron microscopes, detectors and automated procedures in combination with user-friendly image processing software and ever-increasing computational power have made cryo-EM a successful and expanding technology over the past decade1. At resolutions better than 4 Å, atomic model building starts to become possible, but the direct visualization of true atomic positions in protein structure determination requires much higher (better than 1.5 Å) resolution, which so far has not been attained by cryo-EM. The direct visualization of atom positions is essential for understanding the mechanisms of protein-catalysed chemical reactions, and for studying how drugs bind to and interfere with the function of proteins2. Here we report a 1.25 Å-resolution structure of apoferritin obtained by cryo-EM with a newly developed electron microscope that provides, to our knowledge, unprecedented structural detail. Our apoferritin structure has almost twice the 3D information content of the current world record reconstruction (at 1.54 Å resolution3). We can visualize individual atoms in a protein, see density for hydrogen atoms and image single-atom chemical modifications. Beyond the nominal improvement in resolution, we also achieve a substantial improvement in the quality of the cryo-EM density map, which is highly relevant for using cryo-EM in structure-based drug design.},

	abstract = {Previous studies conducted on flexible loop regions in proteins revealed that the energetic consequences of changing loop length predominantly arise from the entropic cost of ordering a loop during folding. However, in an earlier study of human acylphosphatase (hmAcP) using experimental and computational approaches, we showed that thermodynamic stabilization upon loop truncation can be attributed mainly to the increased entropy of the folded state. Here, using 15N NMR spectroscopy, we studied the effect of loop truncation on hmAcP backbone dynamics on the picosecond–nanosecond timescale with the aim of confirming the effect of folded state entropy on protein stability. NMR-relaxation-derived N–H squared generalized order parameters reveal that loop truncation results in a significant increase in protein conformational flexibility. Comparison of these results with previously acquired all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, analyzed here in terms of squared generalized NMR order parameters, demonstrates general agreement between the two methods. The NMR study not only provides direct evidence for the enhanced conformational entropy of the folded state of hmAcP upon loop truncation but also gives a quantitative measure of the observed effects.},

It is well known that B factors are not due to local movements only but reflect several, additional factors from crystal defects, large-scale disorder, diffraction data quality etc. It therefore remains essential to normalize B factors when comparing different crystal structures, although it has clearly been shown that they provide useful information about protein dynamics. Improved, quantitative analyses of raw B factors require novel experimental and computational tools that are able to disaggregate local movements from other features and properties that affect B factors.},

At high salt (200 mm NaCl) and low temperature (10 °C), hLtn adopts a chemokine-like fold, which consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Kuloğlu, E. S., McCaslin, D. R., Kitabwalla, M., Pauza, C. D., Markley, J. L., and Volkman, B. F. (2001) \textit{Biochemistry} 40, 12486–12496). We have used NMR spectroscopy, sedimentation equilibrium, and intrinsic fluorescence to monitor the reversible conformational change undergone by hLtn as a function of temperature and ionic strength. We have used two-, three- and four-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of isotopically enriched protein samples to determine structural properties of the conformational state stabilized at 45 °C and 0 mm NaCl.

The C-terminal α-helix observed at 10 °C and 200 mm NaCl, which is conserved in other chemokines, is absent at 45 °C and no salt, and the last 38 residues of the protein are completely disordered, as indicated by heteronuclear$^{\textrm{15}}$N-$^{\textrm{1}}$H NOEs. Temperature dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence of hLtn in low and high salt confirmed that the chemokine conformation is stabilized by increased ionic strength. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation showed that hLtn at 40 °C in the presence of 100 mm NaCl exists mainly as a dimer. Under near physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, both the chemokine-like and non-chemokine-like conformations of hLtn are significantly populated. The functional relevance of this structural interconversion remains to be elucidated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for biologists interested in the structure, dynamics, and interactions of biological macromolecules. This review aims at presenting in an accessible manner the requirements and limitations of this technique. As an introduction, the history of NMR will highlight how the method evolved from physics to chemistry and finally to biology over several decades. We then introduce the NMR spectral parameters used in structural biology, namely the chemical shift, the J-coupling, nuclear Overhauser effects, and residual dipolar couplings. Resonance assignment, the required step for any further NMR study, bears a resemblance to jigsaw puzzle strategy. The NMR spectral parameters are then converted into angle and distances and used as input using restrained molecular dynamics to compute a bundle of structures. When interpreting a NMR-derived structure, the biologist has to judge its quality on the basis of the statistics provided. When the 3D structure is a priori known by other means, the molecular interaction with a partner can be mapped by NMR: information on the binding interface as well as on kinetic and thermodynamic constants can be gathered. NMR is suitable to monitor, over a wide range of frequencies, protein fluctuations that play a crucial role in their biological function. In the last section of this review, intrinsically disordered proteins, which have escaped the attention of classical structural biology, are discussed in the perspective of NMR, one of the rare available techniques able to describe structural ensembles.

Here, NMR relaxation methods for characterizing thermal motions on the picosecond–nanosecond (ps–ns) timescale are reviewed. Motion on this timescale can be conveniently captured by the Lipari–Szabo order parameter, S2, a bond-specific measure of restriction of motion. Approaches for determining order parameters are discussed, as are recent examples from the literature that link ps–ns dynamics with conformational entropy, allostery, and protein function in general.},

	abstract = {Values of and order parameters derived from NMR relaxation measurements on proteins cannot be used straightforwardly to determine protein structure because they cannot be related to a single protein structure, but are defined in terms of an average over a conformational ensemble. Molecular dynamics simulation can generate a conformational ensemble and thus can be used to restrain and order parameters towards experimentally derived target values (exp) and (exp). Application of and order-parameter restraining MD simulation to bond vectors in 63 side chains of the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 51 (exp) target values and 28 (exp) target values shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimentally derived data can be obtained by using this technique. It is observed that order-parameter restraining of C−H bonds in methyl groups is less reliable than order-parameter restraining because of the possibly less valid assumptions and approximations used to derive experimental (exp) values from NMR relaxation measurements and the necessity to adopt the assumption of uniform rotational motion of methyl C−H bonds around their symmetry axis and of the independence of these motions from each other. The restrained simulations demonstrate that side chains on the protein surface are highly dynamic. Any hydrogen bonds they form and that appear in any of four different crystal structures, are fluctuating with short lifetimes in solution.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

Here we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours across all entities and age groups, and demonstrate its application in a routine diagnostic setting. We show that the availability of this method may have a substantial impact on diagnostic precision compared to standard methods, resulting in a change of diagnosis in up to 12\% of prospective cases. For broader accessibility, we have designed a free online classifier tool, the use of which does not require any additional onsite data processing.

The rapid increase in the number and types of large toxicology data sets together with the advances in computational methods may be used to improve many steps in drug safety evaluation. The development of in silico models to screen and understand mechanisms of drug toxicity may be particularly beneficial in the early stages of drug development where early toxicity assessment can most reduce expenses and labor time. To facilitate this, machine learning methods have been employed to evaluate drug toxicity but are often limited by small and less diverse data sets. Recent advances in machine learning methods together with the rapid increase in big toxicity data such as molecular descriptors, toxicogenomics, and high-throughput bioactivity data may help alleviate some of the current challenges. In this article, the most common machine learning methods used in toxicity assessment are reviewed together with examples of toxicity studies that have used machine learning methodology.

	abstract = {Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The “engine” of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations:  (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had ≥25\% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6\% and 83.7\%, respectively, which were 46∼63\% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss-Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called “Euk-OET-PLoc”, has been designed at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/euk-oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET-KNN classifier.

Starting from the unfolded state and ending either in the native or nonnative conformational states, trajectories are generated with the coarse-grained united residue (UNRES) force field. The effectiveness of principal components analysis (PCA), an already established mathematical technique for finding global, correlated motions in atomic simulations of proteins, is evaluated here for coarse-grained trajectories. The problems related to PCA and their solutions are discussed. The folding and nonfolding of proteins are examined with free-energy landscapes. Detailed analyses of many folding and nonfolding trajectories at different temperatures show that PCA is very efficient for characterizing the general folding and nonfolding features of proteins. It is shown that the first principal component captures and describes in detail the dynamics of a system. Anomalous diffusion in the folding/nonfolding dynamics is examined by the mean-square displacement (MSD) and the fractional diffusion and fractional kinetic equations. The collisionless (or ballistic) behavior of a polypeptide undergoing Brownian motion along the first few principal components is accounted for.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Classifiers are the tools that implement the actual functional mapping from these measurements—also called features or inputs—to the so-called class label—or output. The fields of pattern recognition and machine learning study ways of constructing such classifiers. The main idea behind supervised methods is that of learning from examples: given a number of example input-output relations, to what extent can the general mapping be learned that takes any new and unseen feature vector to its correct class? This chapter provides a basic introduction to the underlying ideas of how to approach a supervised classification problem. In addition, it provides an overview of some specific classification techniques, delves into the issues of object representation and classifier evaluation, and (very) briefly covers some variations on the basic supervised classification task that may also be of interest to the practitioner.},

Determining which are the most appropriate evaluation metrics to effectively assess and evaluate the performance of a binary, multi-class and multi-labelled classifier needs to be further understood. Another significant challenge impacting research is that results from models that are similar in nature cannot be adequately compared if the criteria for the measurement and evaluation of these models are not standardized. This review paper aims at highlighting the various evaluation metrics being applied in research and the non-standardization of evaluation metrics to measure the classification results of the model. Although Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score are the most applied evaluation metrics, there are certain limitations when considering these metrics in isolation. Other metrics such as ROC{\textbackslash}AUC and Kappa statistics have proven to provide additional insightful into the effectiveness of an algorithms adequacy and should also be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of binary, multi-class and multi-labelled classifiers. The adoption of a standardized and consistent evaluation methodology should be explored as an area of future work.},

	abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

Autoencoders are neural networks that can automatically learn useful features and representations from the data; this makes them an ideal technique for simplifying the process of feature engineering in machine learning studies. In addition, autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction, denoising data, generative modeling, and even pretraining deep learning neural networks. In this chapter, we present the fundamental concepts of autoencoders and provide an overview of how they execute these tasks.

Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

We developed a novel program, QUARK, for template-free protein structure prediction. Query sequences are first broken into fragments of 1–20 residues where multiple fragment structures are retrieved at each position from unrelated experimental structures. Full-length structure models are then assembled from fragments using replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations, which are guided by a composite knowledge-based force field. A number of novel energy terms and Monte Carlo movements are introduced and the particular contributions to enhancing the efficiency of both force field and search engine are analyzed in detail. QUARK prediction procedure is depicted and tested on the structure modeling of 145 non-homologous proteins. Although no global templates are used and all fragments from experimental structures with template modeling score (TM-score) {\textgreater}0.5 are excluded, QUARK can successfully construct 3D models of correct folds in 1/3 cases of short proteins up to 100 residues. In the ninth community-wide Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP9) experiment, QUARK server outperformed the second and third best servers by 18\% and 47\% based on the cumulative Z-score of global distance test-total (GDT-TS) scores in the free modeling (FM) category.

	abstract = {How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the “new view” model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon–foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the “how” and the “why” questions.

The resulting proteostasis network is an inextricable part of in vivo protein folding and must be understood in detail if we are to solve the proteome folding problem.

              Accurate prediction of relative solvent accessibilities (RSAs) of amino acid residues in proteins may be used to facilitate protein structure prediction and functional annotation. Toward that goal we developed a novel method for improved prediction of RSAs. Contrary to other machine learning–based methods from the literature, we do not impose a classification problem with arbitrary boundaries between the classes. Instead, we seek a continuous approximation of the real‐value RSA using nonlinear regression, with several feed forward and recurrent neural networks, which are then combined into a consensus predictor. A set of 860 protein structures derived from the PFAM database was used for training, whereas validation of the results was carefully performed on several nonredundant control sets comprising a total of 603 structures derived from new Protein Data Bank structures and had no homology to proteins included in the training. Two classes of alternative predictors were developed for comparison with the regression‐based approach: one based on the standard classification approach and the other based on a semicontinuous approximation with the so‐called thermometer encoding. Furthermore, a weighted approximation, with errors being scaled by the observed levels of variability in RSA for equivalent residues in families of homologous structures, was applied in order to improve the results. The effects of including evolutionary profiles and the growth of sequence databases were assessed. In accord with the observed levels of variability in RSA for different ranges of RSA values, the regression accuracy is higher for buried than for exposed residues, with overall 15.3–15.8\% mean absolute errors and correlation coefficients between the predicted and experimental values of 0.64–0.67 on different control sets. The new method outperforms classification‐based algorithms when the real value predictions are projected onto two‐class classification problems with several commonly used thresholds to separate exposed and buried residues. For example, classification accuracy of about 77\% is consistently achieved on all control sets with a threshold of 25\% RSA. A web server that enables RSA prediction using the new method and provides customizable graphical representation of the results is available at

	doi = {10.1101/2022.02.18.481080},
	abstract = {Abstract
          The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database contains predicted structures for millions of proteins. For the majority of human proteins that contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which do not adopt a stable structure, it is generally assumed these regions have low AlphaFold2 confidence scores that reflect low-confidence structural predictions. Here, we show that AlphaFold2 assigns confident structures to nearly 15\% of human IDRs. By comparison to experimental NMR data for a subset of IDRs that are known to conditionally fold (i.e., upon binding or under other specific conditions), we find that AlphaFold2 often predicts the structure of the conditionally folded state. Based on databases of IDRs that are known to conditionally fold, we estimate that AlphaFold2 can identify conditionally folding IDRs at a precision as high as 88\% at a 10\% false positive rate, which is remarkable considering that conditionally folded IDR structures were minimally represented in its training data. We find that human disease mutations are nearly 5-fold enriched in conditionally folded IDRs over IDRs in general, and that up to 80\% of IDRs in prokaryotes are predicted to conditionally fold, compared to less than 20\% of eukaryotic IDRs. These results indicate that a large majority of IDRs in the proteomes of human and other eukaryotes function in the absence of conditional folding, but the regions that do acquire folds are more sensitive to mutations. We emphasize that the AlphaFold2 predictions do not reveal functionally relevant structural plasticity within IDRs and cannot offer realistic ensemble representations of conditionally folded IDRs.
          
            Significance Statement
            AlphaFold2 and other machine learning-based methods can accurately predict the structures of most proteins. However, nearly two-thirds of human proteins contain segments that are highly flexible and do not autonomously fold, otherwise known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In general, IDRs interconvert rapidly between a large number of different conformations, posing a significant problem for protein structure prediction methods that define one or a small number of stable conformations. Here, we found that AlphaFold2 can readily identify structures for a subset of IDRs that fold under certain conditions (conditional folding). We leverage AlphaFold2’s predictions of conditionally folded IDRs to quantify the extent of conditional folding across the tree of life, and to rationalize disease-causing mutations in IDRs.

	abstract = {A necessary feature of the immune system, TCR (T-cell receptor) cross-reactivity has been implicated in numerous autoimmune pathologies and is an underlying cause of transplant rejection. Early studies of the interactions of αβ TCRs (T-cell receptors) with their peptide–MHC ligands suggested that conformational plasticity in the TCR CDR (complementarity determining region) loops is a dominant contributor to T-cell cross-reactivity. Since these initial studies, the database of TCRs whose structures have been solved both bound and free is now large enough to permit general conclusions to be drawn about the extent of TCR plasticity and the types and locations of motion that occur. In the present paper, we review the conformational differences between free and bound TCRs, quantifying the structural changes that occur and discussing their possible roles in specificity and cross-reactivity. We show that, rather than undergoing major structural alterations or ‘folding’ upon binding, the majority of TCR CDR loops shift by relatively small amounts. The structural changes that do occur are dominated by hinge-bending motions, with loop remodelling usually occurring near loop apexes. As predicted from previous studies, the largest changes are in the hypervariable CDR3α and CDR3β loops, although in some cases the germline-encoded CDR1α and CDR2α loops shift in magnitudes that approximate those of the CDR3 loops. Intriguingly, the smallest shifts are in the germline-encoded loops of the β-chain, consistent with recent suggestions that the TCR β domain may drive ligand recognition.},

              Mass spectrometry-based proteomics empowers deep profiling of proteome and protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we review the advances and limitations in historic and recent AD proteomic research. Complementary to genetic mapping, proteomic studies not only validate canonical amyloid and tau pathways, but also uncover novel components in broad protein networks, such as RNA splicing, development, immunity, membrane transport, lipid metabolism, synaptic function, and mitochondrial activity. Meta-analysis of seven deep datasets reveals 2,698 differentially expressed (DE) proteins in the landscape of AD brain proteome (
              n
               = 12,017 proteins/genes), covering 35 reported AD genes and risk loci. The DE proteins contain cellular markers enriched in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and epithelial cells, supporting the involvement of diverse cell types in AD pathology. We discuss the hypothesized protective or detrimental roles of selected DE proteins, emphasizing top proteins in “amyloidome” (all biomolecules in amyloid plaques) and disease progression. Comprehensive PTM analysis represents another layer of molecular events in AD. In particular, tau PTMs are correlated with disease stages and indicate the heterogeneity of individual AD patients.

	abstract = {The intracellular environment is crowded with macromolecules, including sugars, proteins and nucleic acids. In the cytoplasm, crowding effects are capable of excluding up to 40\% of the volume available to any macromolecule when compared to dilute conditions. NUPR1 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) involved in cell-cycle regulation, stress-cell response, apoptosis processes, DNA binding and repair, chromatin remodeling and transcription. Simulations of molecular crowding predict that IDPs can adopt compact states, as well as more extended conformations under crowding conditions. In this work, we analyzed the conformation and dynamics of NUPR1 in the presence of two synthetic polymers, Ficoll-70 and Dextran-40, which mimic crowding effects in the cells, at two different concentrations (50 and 150 mg/ml). The study was carried out by using a multi-spectroscopic approach, including: site-directed spin labelling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). SDSL-EPR spectra of two spin-labelled mutants indicate that there was binding with the crowders and that the local dynamics of the C and N termini of NUPR1 were partially affected by the crowders. However, the overall disordered nature of NUPR1 did not change substantially in the presence of the crowders, as shown by circular dichroism CD and NMR, and further confirmed by EPR. The changes in the dynamics of the paramagnetic probes appear to be related to preferred local conformations and thus crowding agents partially affect some specific regions, further pinpointing that NUPR1 flexibility has a key physiological role in its activity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Most mutations in cancer are rare, which complicates the identification of therapeutically significant mutations and thus limits the clinical impact of genomic profiling in patients with cancer. Here, we analyzed 24,592 cancers including 10,336 prospectively sequenced patients with advanced disease to identify mutant residues arising more frequently than expected in the absence of selection. We identified 1,165 statistically significant hotspot mutations of which 80\% arose in 1 in 1,000 or fewer patients. Of 55 recurrent in-frame indels, we validated that novel AKT1 duplications induced pathway hyperactivation and conferred AKT inhibitor sensitivity. Cancer genes exhibit different rates of hotspot discovery with increasing sample size, with few approaching saturation. Consequently, 26\% of all hotspots in therapeutically actionable oncogenes were novel. Upon matching a subset of affected patients directly to molecularly targeted therapy, we observed radiographic and clinical responses. Population-scale mutant allele discovery illustrates how the identification of driver mutations in cancer is far from complete.
            Significance: Our systematic computational, experimental, and clinical analysis of hotspot mutations in approximately 25,000 human cancers demonstrates that the long right tail of biologically and therapeutically significant mutant alleles is still incompletely characterized. Sharing prospective genomic data will accelerate hotspot identification, thereby expanding the reach of precision oncology in patients with cancer. Cancer Discov; 8(2); 174–83. ©2017 AACR.

            Structural disorder is widespread in eukaryotic proteins and is vital for their function in diverse biological processes. It is therefore highly desirable to be able to predict the degree of order and disorder from amino acid sequence. It is, however, notoriously difficult to predict the degree of local flexibility within structured domains and the presence and nuances of localized rigidity within intrinsically disordered regions. To identify such instances, we used the CheZOD database, which encompasses accurate, balanced, and continuous-valued quantification of protein (dis)order at amino acid resolution based on NMR chemical shifts. To computationally forecast the spectrum of protein disorder in the most comprehensive manner possible, we constructed the sequence-based protein order/disorder predictor ODiNPred, trained on an expanded version of CheZOD. ODiNPred applies a deep neural network comprising 157 unique sequence features to 1325 protein sequences together with the experimental NMR chemical shift data. Cross-validation for 117 protein sequences shows that ODiNPred better predicts the continuous variation in order along the protein sequence, suggesting that contemporary predictors are limited by the quality of training data. The inclusion of evolutionary features reduces the performance gap between ODiNPred and its peers, but analysis shows that it retains greater accuracy for the more challenging prediction of intermediate disorder.},

              Missing regions in X‐ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have played a foundational role in the study of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), especially in the development of
              in silico
              predictors of intrinsic disorder. However, a missing region is only a weak indication of intrinsic disorder, and this uncertainty is compounded by the presence of ambiguous regions, where more than one structure of the same protein sequence “disagrees” in terms of the presence or absence of missing residues. The question is this: are these ambiguous regions
              intrinsically
              disordered, or are they the result of
              static
              disorder that arises from experimental conditions, ensembles of structures, or domain wobbling? A novel way of looking at ambiguous regions in terms of the pattern between multiple PDB structures has been demonstrated. It was found that the propensity for intrinsic disorder increases as the level of ambiguity decreases. However, it is also shown that ambiguity is more likely to occur as the protein region is placed within different environmental conditions, and even the most ambiguous regions as a set display compositional bias that suggests flexibility. The results suggested that ambiguity is a natural result for many IDPRs crystallized under different conditions and that static disorder and wobbling domains are relatively rare. Instead, it is more likely that ambiguity arises because many of these regions were conditionally or partially disordered.},

	abstract = {Over the past six decades, steadily increasing progress in the application of the principles and techniques of the physical sciences to the study of biological systems has led to remarkable insights into the molecular basis of life. Of particular significance has been the way in which the determination of the structures and dynamical properties of proteins and nucleic acids has so often led directly to a profound understanding of the nature and mechanism of their functional roles. The increasing number and power of experimental and theoretical techniques that can be applied successfully to living systems is now ushering in a new era of structural biology that is leading to fundamentally new information about the maintenance of health, the origins of disease, and the development of effective strategies for therapeutic intervention. This article provides a brief overview of some of the most powerful biophysical methods in use today, along with references that provide more detailed information about recent applications of each of them.
            In addition, this article acts as an introduction to four authoritative reviews in this volume. The first shows the ways that a multiplicity of biophysical methods can be combined with computational techniques to define the architectures of complex biological systems, such as those involving weak interactions within ensembles of molecular components. The second illustrates one aspect of this general approach by describing how recent advances in mass spectrometry, particularly in combination with other techniques, can generate fundamentally new insights into the properties of membrane proteins and their functional interactions with lipid molecules. The third reviewdemonstrates the increasing power of rapidly evolving diffraction techniques, employing the very short bursts of X-rays of extremely high intensity that are now accessible as a result of the construction of free-electron lasers, in particular to carry out time-resolved studies of biochemical reactions. The fourth describes in detail the application of such approaches to probe the mechanism of the light-induced changes associated with bacteriorhodopsin's ability to convert light energy into chemical energy.},

              Motivation
              It is commonplace that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are involved in crucial interactions in the living cell. However, the study of protein complexes formed exclusively by IDPs is hindered by the lack of data and such analyses remain sporadic. Systematic studies benefited other types of protein–protein interactions paving a way from basic science to therapeutics; yet these efforts require reliable datasets that are currently lacking for synergistically folding complexes of IDPs.
            
            
              Results
              Here we present the Mutual Folding Induced by Binding (MFIB) database, the first systematic collection of complexes formed exclusively by IDPs. MFIB contains an order of magnitude more data than any dataset used in corresponding studies and offers a wide coverage of known IDP complexes in terms of flexibility, oligomeric composition and protein function from all domains of life. The included complexes are grouped using a hierarchical classification and are complemented with structural and functional annotations. MFIB is backed by a firm development team and infrastructure, and together with possible future community collaboration it will provide the cornerstone for structural and functional studies of IDP complexes.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              MFIB is freely accessible at http://mfib.enzim.ttk.mta.hu/. The MFIB application is hosted by Apache web server and was implemented in PHP. To enrich querying features and to enhance backend performance a MySQL database was also created.

              COSMIC is currently the most comprehensive global resource for information on somatic mutations in human cancer, combining curation of the scientific literature with tumor resequencing data from the Cancer Genome Project at the Sanger Institute, U.K. Almost 4800 genes and 250000 tumors have been examined, resulting in over 50000 mutations available for investigation. This information can be accessed in a number of ways, the most convenient being the Web‐based system which allows detailed data mining, presenting the results in easily interpretable formats. This unit describes the graphical system in detail, elaborating an example walkthrough and the many ways that the resulting information can be thoroughly investigated by combining data, respecializing the query, or viewing the results in different ways. Alternate protocols overview the available precompiled data files available for download.

              Motivation
              Protein intrinsic disorder describes the tendency of sequence residues to not fold into a rigid three-dimensional shape by themselves. However, some of these disordered regions can transition from disorder to order when interacting with another molecule in segments known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Previous analysis has shown that these MoRF regions are indirectly encoded within the prediction of residue disorder as low-confidence predictions [i.e. in a semi-disordered state P(D)≈0.5]. Thus, what has been learned for disorder prediction may be transferable to MoRF prediction. Transferring the internal characterization of protein disorder for the prediction of MoRF residues would allow us to take advantage of the large training set available for disorder prediction, enabling the training of larger analytical models than is currently feasible on the small number of currently available annotated MoRF proteins. In this paper, we propose a new method for MoRF prediction by transfer learning from the SPOT-Disorder2 ensemble models built for disorder prediction.
            
            
              Results
              We confirm that directly training on the MoRF set with a randomly initialized model yields substantially poorer performance on independent test sets than by using the transfer-learning-based method SPOT-MoRF, for both deep and simple networks. Its comparison to current state-of-the-art techniques reveals its superior performance in identifying MoRF binding regions in proteins across two independent testing sets, including our new dataset of \&gt;800 protein chains. These test chains share \&lt;30\% sequence similarity to all training and validation proteins used in SPOT-Disorder2 and SPOT-MoRF, and provide a much-needed large-scale update on the performance of current MoRF predictors. The method is expected to be useful in locating functional disordered regions in proteins.

            Intrinsically disordered or unstructured proteins (or regions in proteins) have been found to be important in a wide range of biological functions and implicated in many diseases. Due to the high cost and low efficiency of experimental determination of intrinsic disorder and the exponential increase of unannotated protein sequences, developing complementary computational prediction methods has been an active area of research for several decades. Here, we employed an ensemble of deep Squeeze-and-Excitation residual inception and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for predicting protein intrinsic disorder with input from evolutionary information and predicted one-dimensional structural properties. The method, called SPOT-Disorder2, offers substantial and consistent improvement not only over our previous technique based on LSTM networks alone, but also over other state-of-the-art techniques in three independent tests with different ratios of disordered to ordered amino acid residues, and for sequences with either rich or limited evolutionary information. More importantly, semi-disordered regions predicted in SPOT-Disorder2 are more accurate in identifying molecular recognition features (MoRFs) than methods directly designed for MoRFs prediction. SPOT-Disorder2 is available as a web server and as a standalone program at https://sparks-lab.org/server/spot-disorder2/.},

            The Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt, URL: https://disprot.org) provides manually curated annotations of intrinsically disordered proteins from the literature. Here we report recent developments with DisProt (version 8), including the doubling of protein entries, a new disorder ontology, improvements of the annotation format and a completely new website. The website includes a redesigned graphical interface, a better search engine, a clearer API for programmatic access and a new annotation interface that integrates text mining technologies. The new entry format provides a greater flexibility, simplifies maintenance and allows the capture of more information from the literature. The new disorder ontology has been formalized and made interoperable by adopting the OWL format, as well as its structure and term definitions have been improved. The new annotation interface has made the curation process faster and more effective. We recently showed that new DisProt annotations can be effectively used to train and validate disorder predictors. We believe the growth of DisProt will accelerate, contributing to the improvement of function and disorder predictors and therefore to illuminate the ‘dark’ proteome.},

With ensemble refinement, the properties of dynamic and partially disordered (bio)molecular structures can be characterized by integrating a wide range of experimental data, including measurements of ensemble-averaged observables. We start from a Bayesian formulation in which the posterior is a functional that ranks different configuration space distributions. By maximizing this posterior, we derive an optimal Bayesian ensemble distribution. For discrete configurations, this optimal distribution is identical to that obtained by the maximum entropy “ensemble refinement of SAXS” (EROS) formulation. Bayesian replica ensemble refinement enhances the sampling of relevant configurations by imposing restraints on averages of observables in coupled replica molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the strength of the restraints should scale linearly with the number of replicas to ensure convergence to the optimal Bayesian result in the limit of infinitely many replicas. In the “Bayesian inference of ensembles” method, we combine the replica and EROS approaches to accelerate the convergence. An adaptive algorithm can be used to sample directly from the optimal ensemble, without replicas. We discuss the incorporation of single-molecule measurements and dynamic observables such as relaxation parameters. The theoretical analysis of different Bayesian ensemble refinement approaches provides a basis for practical applications and a starting point for further investigations.},

            Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are crucial components of the cell, they are highly abundant and participate ubiquitously in a wide range of biological functions, such as regulatory processes and cell signaling. Many of their important functions rely on protein interactions, by which they trigger or modulate different pathways. Sequence covariation, a powerful tool for protein contact prediction, has been applied successfully to predict protein structure and to identify protein–protein interactions mostly of globular proteins. IDPs/IDRs also mediate a plethora of protein–protein interactions, highlighting the importance of addressing sequence covariation-based inter-protein contact prediction of this class of proteins. Despite their importance, a systematic approach to analyze the covariation phenomena of intrinsically disordered proteins and their complexes is still missing. Here we carry out a comprehensive critical assessment of coevolution-based contact prediction in IDP/IDR complexes and detail the challenges and possible limitations that emerge from their analysis. We found that the coevolutionary signal is faint in most of the complexes of disordered proteins but positively correlates with the interface size and binding affinity between partners. In addition, we discuss the state-of-art methodology by biological interpretation of the results, formulate evaluation guidelines and suggest future directions of development to the field.},

            Results: We describe DISOPRED3, which extends its predecessor with new modules to predict IDRs and protein-binding sites within them. Based on recent CASP evaluation results, DISOPRED3 can be regarded as state of the art in the identification of IDRs, and our self-assessment shows that it significantly improves over DISOPRED2 because its predictions are more specific across the whole board and more sensitive to IDRs longer than 20 amino acids. Predicted IDRs are annotated as protein binding through a novel SVM based classifier, which uses profile data and additional sequence-derived features. Based on benchmarking experiments with full cross-validation, we show that this predictor generates precise assignments of disordered protein binding regions and that it compares well with other publicly available tools.

            The ability to predict local structural features of a protein from the primary sequence is of paramount importance for unraveling its function in absence of experimental structural information. Two main factors affect the utility of potential prediction tools: their accuracy must enable extraction of reliable structural information on the proteins of interest, and their runtime must be low to keep pace with sequencing data being generated at a constantly increasing speed. Here, we present NetSurfP‐2.0, a novel tool that can predict the most important local structural features with unprecedented accuracy and runtime. NetSurfP‐2.0 is sequence‐based and uses an architecture composed of convolutional and long short‐term memory neural networks trained on solved protein structures. Using a single integrated model, NetSurfP‐2.0 predicts solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder, and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of the input sequences. We assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP‐2.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state‐of‐the‐art predictions for each of its output features. We observe a correlation of 80\% between predictions and experimental data for solvent accessibility, and a precision of 85\% on secondary structure 3‐class predictions. In addition to improved accuracy, the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1000 proteins in less than 2 hours, and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Protein folding has been a “holy grail” problem of biology for fifty years, and the recent breakthrough from AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold set a profound milestone for solving this problem. AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold were successful in predicting protein structures from peptide sequences with high accuracy. Meanwhile, although the protein folding problem also cares about the kinetic pathways of protein folding, AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold were not trained with this functionality. Considering that their training sets contain proteins from foldable sequences and sequence evolutionary information, we wondered if the computational models from AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold might carry protein foldability information. To test this idea, we systematically predicted the structural models of 149 circular permutants and 148 alanine insertion mutants of the 149-residue dihydrofolate reductase of Escherichia coli with AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold. Our data showed that although AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold could not directly identify unfoldable proteins, the structural variations of computational models are correlated with protein foldability. Furthermore, this correlation is independent of secondary structures. Most importantly, the structural variations of computational models are quantitatively correlated with protein foldability but not protein function. Our work could be of great value to the design of circular permutants, the design of fragment complementary proteins, the design of novel proteins, and the development of computational tools for predicting protein folding kinetics.

            Motivation: Accurately predicting protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility is important for the study of protein evolution, structure and function and as a component of protein 3D structure prediction pipelines. Most predictors use a combination of machine learning and profiles, and thus must be retrained and assessed periodically as the number of available protein sequences and structures continues to grow.
            Results: We present newly trained modular versions of the SSpro and ACCpro predictors of secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility together with their multi-class variants SSpro8 and ACCpro20. We introduce a sharp distinction between the use of sequence similarity alone, typically in the form of sequence profiles at the input level, and the additional use of sequence-based structural similarity, which uses similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank to infer annotations at the output level, and study their relative contributions to modern predictors. Using sequence similarity alone, SSpro’s accuracy is between 79 and 80\% (79\% for ACCpro) and no other predictor seems to exceed 82\%. However, when sequence-based structural similarity is added, the accuracy of SSpro rises to 92.9\% (90\% for ACCpro). Thus, by combining both approaches, these problems appear now to be essentially solved, as an accuracy of 100\% cannot be expected for several well-known reasons. These results point also to several open technical challenges, including (i) achieving on the order of ≥80\% accuracy, without using any similarity with known proteins and (ii) achieving on the order of ≥85\% accuracy, using sequence similarity alone.

              Summary
              Motivation. Predicting the native state of a protein has long been considered a gateway problem for understanding protein folding. Recent advances in structural modeling driven by deep learning have achieved unprecedented success at predicting a protein’s crystal structure, but it is not clear if these models are learning the physics of how proteins dynamically fold into their equilibrium structure or are just accurate knowledge-based predictors of the final state.
              Results. In this work, we compare the pathways generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods to experimental data about protein folding pathways. The methods considered were AlphaFold 2, RoseTTAFold, trRosetta, RaptorX, DMPfold, EVfold, SAINT2 and Rosetta. We find evidence that their simulated dynamics capture some information about the folding pathway, but their predictive ability is worse than a trivial classifier using sequence-agnostic features like chain length. The folding trajectories produced are also uncorrelated with experimental observables such as intermediate structures and the folding rate constant. These results suggest that recent advances in structure prediction do not yet provide an enhanced understanding of protein folding.

              Summary
              Polypeptides are exposed to changing environmental conditions that modulate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.

              Motivation
              Proteins able to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vivo and in vitro are drawing a lot of interest, due to their functional relevance for cell life. Nevertheless, the proteome-scale experimental screening of these proteins seems unfeasible, because besides being expensive and time-consuming, LLPS is heavily influenced by multiple environmental conditions such as concentration, pH and temperature, thus requiring a combinatorial number of experiments for each protein.
            
            
              Results
              To overcome this problem, we propose a neural network model able to predict the LLPS behavior of proteins given specified experimental conditions, effectively predicting the outcome of in vitro experiments. Our model can be used to rapidly screen proteins and experimental conditions searching for LLPS, thus reducing the search space that needs to be covered experimentally. We experimentally validate Droppler’s prediction on the TAR DNA-binding protein in different experimental conditions, showing the consistency of its predictions.

	abstract = {The natively unfolded nature of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) relies on several physicochemical principles, of which the balance between a low sequence hydrophobicity and a high net charge appears to be critical. Under this premise, it is well-known that disordered proteins populate a defined region of the charge–hydropathy (C–H) space and that a linear boundary condition is sufficient to distinguish between folded and disordered proteins, an approach widely applied for the prediction of protein disorder. Nevertheless, it is evident that the C–H relation of a protein is not unalterable but can be modulated by factors extrinsic to its sequence. Here, we applied a C–H-based analysis to develop a computational approach that evaluates sequence disorder as a function of pH, assuming that both protein net charge and hydrophobicity are dependent on pH solution. On that basis, we developed DispHred, the first pH-dependent predictor of protein disorder. Despite its simplicity, DispHred displays very high accuracy in identifying pH-induced order/disorder protein transitions. DispHred might be useful for diverse applications, from the analysis of conditionally disordered segments to the synthetic design of disorder tags for biotechnological applications. Importantly, since many disorder predictors use hydrophobicity as an input, the here developed framework can be implemented in other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Moreover, it is a central concern in the manufacturing of recombinant proteins for biotechnological and therapeutic applications. Nevertheless, the unique architecture of protein aggregates is also exploited by nature for functional purposes, from bacteria to humans. The relevance of this process in health and disease has boosted the interest in understanding and controlling aggregation, with the concomitant development of a myriad of algorithms aimed to predict aggregation propensities. However, most of these programs are blind to the protein environment and, in particular, to the influence of the pH. Here, we developed an empirical equation to model the pH-dependent aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) based on the assumption that both the global protein charge and lipophilicity depend on the solution pH. Upon its parametrization with a model IDP, this simple phenomenological approach showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting the dependence of the aggregation of both pathogenic and functional amyloidogenic IDPs on the pH. The algorithm might be useful for diverse applications, from large-scale analysis of IDPs aggregation properties to the design of novel reversible nanofibrillar materials.},

	abstract = {Glycosylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications to occur in protein biosynthesis, yet its effect on the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteins is poorly understood. A minimalist model based on the native protein topology, in which each amino acid and sugar ring was represented by a single bead, was used to study the effect of glycosylation on protein folding. We studied
              in silico
              the folding of 63 engineered SH3 domain variants that had been glycosylated with different numbers of conjugated polysaccharide chains at different sites on the protein's surface. Thermal stabilization of the protein by the polysaccharide chains was observed in proportion to the number of attached chains. Consistent with recent experimental data, the degree of thermal stabilization depended on the position of the glycosylation sites, but only very weakly on the size of the glycans. A thermodynamic analysis showed that the origin of the enhanced protein stabilization by glycosylation is destabilization of the unfolded state rather than stabilization of the folded state. The higher free energy of the unfolded state is enthalpic in origin because the bulky polysaccharide chains force the unfolded ensemble to adopt more extended conformations by prohibiting formation of a residual structure. The thermodynamic stabilization induced by glycosylation is coupled with kinetic stabilization. The effects introduced by the glycans on the biophysical properties of proteins are likely to be relevant to other protein polymeric conjugate systems that regularly occur in the cell as posttranslational modifications or for biotechnological purposes.},

              Motivation
              Knowing protein secondary and other one-dimensional structural properties are essential for accurate protein structure and function prediction. As a result, many methods have been developed for predicting these one-dimensional structural properties. However, most methods relied on evolutionary information that may not exist for many proteins due to a lack of sequence homologs. Moreover, it is computationally intensive for obtaining evolutionary information as the library of protein sequences continues to expand exponentially. Here, we developed a new single-sequence method called SPOT-1D-Single based on a large training dataset of 39 120 proteins deposited prior to 2016 and an ensemble of hybrid long-short-term-memory bidirectional neural network and convolutional neural network.
            
            
              Results
              We showed that SPOT-1D-Single consistently improves over SPIDER3-Single and ProteinUnet for secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact number and backbone angles prediction for all seven independent test sets (TEST2018, SPOT-2016, SPOT-2016-HQ, SPOT-2018, SPOT-2018-HQ, CASP12 and CASP13 free-modeling targets). For example, the predicted three-state secondary structure’s accuracy ranges from 72.12\% to 74.28\% by SPOT-1D-Single, compared to 69.1–72.6\% by SPIDER3-Single and 70.6–73\% by ProteinUnet. SPOT-1D-Single also predicts SS3 and SS8 with 6.24\% and 6.98\% better accuracy than SPOT-1D on SPOT-2018 proteins with no homologs (Neff = 1), respectively. The new method’s improvement over existing techniques is due to a larger training set combined with ensembled learning.

	abstract = {Ubiquitination regulates many essential cellular processes in eukaryotes. This post-translational modification (PTM) is typically achieved by E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that sequentially catalyze activation, conjugation, and ligation reactions, respectively, leading to covalent attachment of ubiquitin, usually to lysine residues of substrate proteins. Ubiquitin can also be successively linked to one of the seven lysine residues on ubiquitin to form distinctive forms of polyubiquitin chains, which, depending upon the lysine used and the length of the chains, dictate the fate of substrate proteins. Recent discoveries revealed that this ubiquitin code is further expanded by PTMs such as phosphorylation, acetylation, deamidation, and ADP-ribosylation, on ubiquitin, components of the ubiquitination machinery, or both. These PTMs provide additional regulatory nodes to integrate development or insulting signals with cellular homeostasis. Understanding the precise roles of these PTMs in the regulation of ubiquitin signaling will provide new insights into the mechanisms and treatment of various human diseases linked to ubiquitination, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, infection, and immune disorders.},

            Motivation: Redundant protein sequences in biological databases hinder sequence similarity searches and make interpretation of search results difficult. Clustering of protein sequence space based on sequence similarity helps organize all sequences into manageable datasets and reduces sampling bias and overrepresentation of sequences.
            Results: The UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and selected UniProt Archive records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Currently covering \&gt;4 million source sequences, the UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single UniRef entry. UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences at the 90 or 50\% sequence identity levels. UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 yield a database size reduction of ∼10, 40 and 70\%, respectively, from the source sequence set. The reduced redundancy increases the speed of similarity searches and improves detection of distant relationships. UniRef entries contain summary cluster and membership information, including the sequence of a representative protein, member count and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in UniProtKB to facilitate biological discovery. UniRef has already been applied to broad research areas ranging from genome annotation to proteomics data analysis.

          , 
            
              Signal transduction is the primary process by which cells respond to changes in their physical and chemical environments. Cellular response is initiated through a signaling protein (a receptor), which interacts with the “signal”, most often a novel molecule outside or inside the cell. The mechanism of activation of the receptor is a conformational change and/or covalent modification, which then sets in motion a signaling pathway,
              i.e.
              a cascade of modification and binding events that relay and amplify the message to eventually alter the state of the cell. In reflection of this general perception, concepts such as the “second messenger” and the “phosphorylation cascade” dominate our views of signal transduction. The idea I advocate here is that the non-covalent change in protein conformation itself might serve as the initial or intermittent “signal” in the cascade, and it is often the primary event being recognized and interpreted by downstream receptor(s). This signaling principle is intertwined with many other cellular regulatory concepts, such as (pathway) allostery, conformational spread, induced folding/unfolding, conformational memory, the hierarchical assembly of complexes, and the action of regulatory chaperones and prions. By elaborating on many examples and also recent advances in experimental methodology, I show that conformational signaling, although thus far underappreciated, is a general and robust signaling principle that most of the time operates in close interplay with covalent signals in the cell.},

              Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure
              1
              . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold
              2
              , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

            The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences annotated with functional information. In this article, we describe significant updates that we have made over the last two years to the resource. The number of sequences in UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

Multivalent interactions of modular binding domains and their target motifs can drive phase separation. However, forces promoting the more common phase separation of intrinsically disordered regions are less understood, with suggested roles for multivalent cation-pi, pi-pi, and charge interactions and the hydrophobic effect. Known phase-separating proteins are enriched in pi-orbital containing residues and thus we analyzed pi-interactions in folded proteins. We found that pi-pi interactions involving non-aromatic groups are widespread, underestimated by force-fields used in structure calculations and correlated with solvation and lack of regular secondary structure, properties associated with disordered regions. We present a phase separation predictive algorithm based on pi interaction frequency, highlighting proteins involved in biomaterials and RNA processing.},

          , 
            Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions offer numerous advantages in the context of protein–protein interactions when compared to the structured proteins and domains. These advantages include ability to interact with multiple partners, to fold into different conformations when bound to different partners, and to undergo disorder-to-order transitions concomitant with their functional activity. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are widespread elements located in disordered regions that undergo disorder-to-order transition upon binding to their protein partners. We characterize abundance, composition, and functions of MoRFs and their association with the disordered regions across 868 species spread across Eukaryota, Bacteria and Archaea. We found that although disorder is substantially elevated in Eukaryota, MoRFs have similar abundance and amino acid composition across the three domains of life. The abundance of MoRFs is highly correlated with the amount of intrinsic disorder in Bacteria and Archaea but only modestly correlated in Eukaryota. Proteins with MoRFs have significantly more disorder and MoRFs are present in many disordered regions, with Eukaryota having more MoRF-free disordered regions. MoRF-containing proteins are enriched in the ribosome, nucleus, nucleolus and microtubule and are involved in translation, protein transport, protein folding, and interactions with DNAs. Our insights into the nature and function of MoRFs enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disorder-to-order transition and protein–protein recognition and interactions. The fMoRFpred method that we used to annotate MoRFs is available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/fMoRFpred/.},

In this perspective, we review a variety of enhanced sampling methods. We first discuss collective-variables-based methods including metadynamics and variationally enhanced sampling. Then, collective variable free methods such as parallel tempering and integrated tempering methods are presented. At last, we conclude with a brief introduction of some newly developed combinatory methods. We summarize in this perspective not only the theoretical background and numerical implementation of these methods but also the new challenges and prospects in the field of the enhanced sampling.},

            The ribosome is a major target for clinically used antibiotics, but multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria are making our current arsenal of antimicrobials obsolete. Here we present cryo-electron-microscopy structures of 17 distinct compounds from six different antibiotic classes bound to the bacterial ribosome at resolutions ranging from 1.6 to 2.2 Å. The improved resolution enables a precise description of antibiotic–ribosome interactions, encompassing solvent networks that mediate multiple additional interactions between the drugs and their target. Our results reveal a high structural conservation in the binding mode between antibiotics with the same scaffold, including ordered water molecules. Water molecules are visualized within the antibiotic binding sites that are preordered, become ordered in the presence of the drug and that are physically displaced on drug binding. Insight into RNA–ligand interactions will facilitate development of new antimicrobial agents, as well as other RNA-targeting therapies.},

	abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has the unique advantage of elucidating the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in solution at physiological temperatures, where they are in constant movement on timescales from picoseconds to milliseconds. Such motions have been shown to be critical for enzyme catalysis, allosteric regulation, and molecular recognition. With NMR being particularly sensitive to these timescales, detailed information about the kinetics can be acquired. However, nearly all methods of NMR-based biomolecular structure determination neglect kinetics, which introduces a large approximation to the underlying physics, limiting both structural resolution and the ability to accurately determine molecular flexibility. Here we present the Kinetic Ensemble approach that uses a hierarchy of interconversion rates between a set of ensemble members to rigorously calculate Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) intensities. It can be used to simultaneously refine both temporal and structural coordinates. By generalizing ideas from the extended model free approach, the method can analyze the amplitudes and kinetics of motions anywhere along the backbone or side chains. Furthermore, analysis of a large set of crystal structures suggests that NOE data contains a surprising amount of high-resolution information that is better modeled using our approach. The Kinetic Ensemble approach provides the means to unify numerous types of experiments under a single quantitative framework and more fully characterize and exploit kinetically distinct protein states. While we apply the approach here to the protein ubiquitin and cross validate it with previously derived datasets, the approach can be applied to any protein for which NOE data is available.},

In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions. This protocol details the basic steps of obtaining and interpreting CD data, and methods for analyzing spectra to estimate the secondary structural composition of proteins. CD has the advantage that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing ≤20 μg of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours.

	abstract = {The usefulness of representing an ensemble of NMR-derived protein structures by a single structure has been investigated. Two stereochemical properties have been used to assess how a single structure relates to the ensemble from which it was derived, namely the distribution of ϕΨ torsion angles and the distribution of χ1 torsion angles. The results show that the minimized average structure derived from the ensemble (a total of 11 ensembles from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were analyzed) does not always correspond well with this ensemble, particularly for those ensembles generated with a smaller number of experimentally derived restraints per residue. An alternative method that selects the member of the ensemble which is closest to the “average” of the ensemble has been investigated (a total of 23 ensembles from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were analyzed). Although this method selected a structure that on the whole corresponded more closely to the ensemble than did the minimized average structure, this is still not a totally reliable means of selecting a single structure to represent the ensemble. This suggests that it is advisable to study the ensemble as a whole. A study has also been made of the practice of selecting the “best” rather than the most representative member of the ensemble. This too suggests that the ensemble should be studied as a whole. A study of the conformational space occupied by the ensemble also suggests the need to consider the ensemble as a whole, particularly for those ensembles generated with a smaller number of experimentally derived restraints per residue.},
